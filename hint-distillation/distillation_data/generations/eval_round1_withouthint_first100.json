Every cell \\( x_{ij} \\) is either a horizontal maximum (max in its row up to column \\( j \\)) or a vertical maximum (max in its column up to row \\( i \\)).\n2. Each row has at most \\( m \\) horizontal maxima.\n3. Each column has at most \\( m \\) vertical maxima.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing the Array\nConsider the array \\( x_{ij} \\) where \\( x_{ij} = i + j \\). This choice ensures that each cell is either a horizontal maximum or a vertical maximum.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying the Array\nFor the array \\( x_{ij} = i + j \\):\n- A cell \\( x_{ij} \\) is a horizontal maximum if \\( x_{ij} \\geq x_{ik} \\) for all \\( k \\leq j \\). This means \\( i + j \\geq i + k \\) or \\( j \\geq k \\), so \\( x_{ij} \\) is the maximum of its row up to column \\( j \\).\n- A cell \\( x_{ij} \\) is a vertical maximum if \\( x_{ij} \\geq x_{kj} \\) for all \\( k \\leq i \\). This means \\( i + j \\geq k + j \\) or \\( i \\geq k \\), so \\( x_{ij} \\) is the maximum of its column up to row \\( i \\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Maxima\n- In each row \\( i \\), the horizontal maxima are \\( x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ii} \\). There are exactly \\( i \\) such maxima.\n- In each column \\( j \\), the vertical maxima are \\( x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\ldots, x_{jj} \\). There are exactly \\( j \\) such maxima.\n\n### Step 5: Bounding \\( m \\)\nTo satisfy conditions (2) and (3), we need to ensure that no row or column has more than \\( m \\) maxima. From the above, we see that:\n- The maximum number of horizontal maxima in any row \\( i \\) is \\( i \\).\n- The maximum number of vertical maxima in any column \\( j \\) is \\( j \\).\n\nTo find the minimum \\( m \\) such that both conditions are satisfied, we need \\( m \\) to be at least the maximum of these values for all \\( i \\) and \\( j \\). Since \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) can be any integer from 1 to \\( n \\), the maximum value of \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) is \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the minimum \\( m \\) that satisfies both conditions is \\( n \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{n}\n\\]"

A proper directed-edge-coloring assigns colors to the edges such that for every pair of directed edges \\(\\overrightarrow{uv}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{vw}\\), these two edges are in different colors. The goal is to find the minimum number of colors required to achieve this.\n\n### Step 2: Base Case\nFor \\( n = 2 \\), the tournament consists of two vertices \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) with either \\(\\overrightarrow{uv}\\) or \\(\\overrightarrow{vu}\\). We can color the single edge with one color. Thus, the directed-edge-chromatic-number is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Recursive Step\nConsider a tournament with \\( n \\) vertices. Fix a vertex \\( v \\) and partition the remaining \\( n-1 \\) vertices into two sets:\n- \\( A \\): vertices that are reachable from \\( v \\) (i.e., there is a directed path from \\( v \\) to these vertices).\n- \\( B \\): vertices that can reach \\( v \\) (i.e., there is a directed path from these vertices to \\( v \\)).\n\n### Step 4: Induced Subtournaments\nThe subtournaments induced by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are smaller tournaments themselves. Let \\( |A| = a \\) and \\( |B| = b \\) with \\( a + b = n-1 \\). The edges between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) can be colored with one color because the direction of the edges is consistent (either all from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) or from \\( B \\) to \\( A \\)).\n\n### Step 5: Coloring the Edges\n- Color the edges within \\( A \\) using the minimum number of colors required for a tournament with \\( a \\) vertices.\n- Color the edges within \\( B \\) using the minimum number of colors required for a tournament with \\( b \\) vertices.\n- Color the edges between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) with one additional color.\n\n### Step 6: Recursive Formula\nThe directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament with \\( n \\) vertices is the sum of the directed-edge-chromatic-number of the subtournaments induced by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), plus one for the edges between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nLet \\( f(n) \\) be the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament with \\( n \\) vertices.

For \\( n = 2 \\), we have \\( f(2) = 1 \\).\n\nAssume \\( f(k) = k-1 \\) for all \\( k < n \\). Then:\n\\[ f(n) = \\min_{a+b=n-1} \\left( f(a) + f(b) + 1 \\right) = \\min_{a+b=n-1} \\left( (a-1) + (b-1) + 1 \\right) = \\min_{a+b=n-1} (a + b - 1) = n-1 \\]\n\nThus, by induction, \\( f(n) = n-1 \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number over all tournaments on \\( n \\) vertices is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n-1}\n\\]"

For \\(x \\geq 0\\), all terms \\(a_i x^i\\) are positive because \\(a_i > 0\\) for all \\(i\\). Therefore, \\(P(x) > 0\\) for \\(x \\geq 0\\). This means that \\(P(x)\\) does not have any positive real roots.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that \\(P(x)\\) does not have any negative real roots. To do this, we can use the fact that for a polynomial to have a negative real root, the polynomial evaluated at that root must be zero, and the signs of the coefficients must alternate in a specific way. However, since all the coefficients \\(a_i\\) are positive, the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) cannot have a negative real root because the polynomial will always be positive for any negative \\(x\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the permutations of the coefficients.

To ensure that \\(P_{i,j}(x)\\) has at least one real root, we need to consider the behavior of the polynomial at specific points. For example, if we evaluate \\(P_{i,j}(x)\\) at \\(x = -1\\), the signs of the terms will depend on the parity of the exponents and the specific values of \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_j\\). If we choose \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_j\\) such that the signs of the terms alternate in a way that allows the polynomial to cross the x-axis, then \\(P_{i,j}(x)\\) will have a real root.\n\nTo summarize, we can choose the coefficients \\(a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{19}\\) such that \\(a_0 < a_2 < a_4 < \\cdots < a_{16} < a_{18} < a_{17} < a_{15} < \\cdots < a_1 < a_0\\), and all \\(a_i\\) are very large and very close to each other. This ensures that \\(P(x)\\) is positive for all \\(x \\geq 0\\) and does not have any negative real roots. However, by swapping the coefficients \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_j\\) such that the signs of the terms alternate in a way that allows the polynomial to cross the x-axis, we can ensure that \\(P_{i,j}(x)\\) has at least one real root.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\\)."

The maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\leq 5 \\).\n2. The graph contains no complete subgraph \\( K_5 \\) (i.e., among any 5 vertices, there is at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices).\n\n### Step 2: Upper Bound on the Independence Number\nThe independence number \\( \\alpha(G) \\) is the size of the largest set of vertices in \\( G \\) such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. We need to find an upper bound for \\( \\alpha(G) \\).\n\nUsing the fact that \\( \\Delta(G) \\leq 5 \\), we can use the Tur\u00e1n's theorem for \\( K_5 \\)-free graphs.

To do this, we will use the fact that \\( G \\) is \\( K_5 \\)-free and has a maximum degree of 5.\n\nConsider a vertex \\( v \\) in \\( G \\). Since \\( \\deg(v) \\leq 5 \\), \\( v \\) is adjacent to at most 5 other vertices. This means that \\( v \\) is not adjacent to at least \\( 30 - 6 = 24 \\) other vertices.

Since \\( G \\) is \\( K_5 \\)-free, \\( G' \\) is also \\( K_5 \\)-free. The maximum degree of \\( G' \\) is at most 5, and we can apply the same argument to \\( G' \\). By repeating this process, we can find a set of 12 vertices that are all not adjacent to each other.\n\n### Step 4: Construction to Show sharpness\nTo show that \\( \\alpha(G) = 12 \\) is achievable, we can construct a graph \\( G \\) with 30 vertices where the independence number is exactly 12. One such construction is to take 6 disjoint copies of \\( K_5 \\) and connect them such that no two vertices from different \\( K_5 \\) are adjacent.

Here, \\( S \\) is a set with \\( |S| = 35 \\).\n\nFirst, let's understand what property \\( P(k) \\) means.

However, since \\( S \\) has only 35 elements, it is possible to map any element to any other element in just 34 steps. This is because if we have 35 elements and we want to map one element to another, we can do this in at most 34 steps by possibly using some intermediate elements.\n\nTherefore, if \\( F \\) satisfies \\( P(2019) \\), it must also satisfy \\( P(34) \\) because 34 is the maximum number of steps needed to map any element to any other element in \\( S \\). Any sequence of 2019 functions can be reduced to a sequence of 34 functions because the set \\( S \\) is finite and the functions can be composed to achieve the same result in fewer steps.\n\nThus, the least positive integer \\( m \\) such that if \\( F \\) satisfies \\( P(2019) \\), then it also satisfies \\( P(m) \\) is \\( \\boxed{34} \\)."

For \\( g(x) + kx \\) to be a permutation for all \\( k \\) in this range, \\( k \\) must be coprime to \\( n \\) for each \\( k \\).\n\n6. **Prime Factor Consideration:**\n   - The numbers from 0 to 100 include all integers from 1 to 100. For \\( n \\) to be coprime to all integers from 1 to 100, \\( n \\) must be a prime number greater than 100. This is because any composite number \\( n \\) would share a prime factor with at least one of the numbers from 1 to 100.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are those that are prime and greater than 100.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{All prime numbers greater than 100}}\n\\]"

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given condition\nThe condition \\( f(f(x) + y) \\mid x + f(y) \\) must hold for all positive integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 2: Consider the case when \\( y = 1 \\)\nSubstitute \\( y = 1 \\) into the condition:\n\\[ f(f(x) + 1) \\mid x + f(1). \\]\nThis tells us that \\( f(f(x) + 1) \\) is a divisor of \\( x + f(1) \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\).\n\n### Step 3: Consider the case when \\( x = 1 \\)\nSubstitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the condition:\n\\[ f(f(1) + y) \\mid 1 + f(y). \\]\nThis tells us that \\( f(f(1) + y) \\) is a divisor of \\( 1 + f(y) \\) for all \\( y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\).\n\n### Step 4: Consider the case when \\( y = 0 \\)\nSince \\( f \\) maps positive integers to positive integers, we need to consider the behavior of \\( f \\) at positive integers only. However, we can infer something by considering the behavior of \\( f \\) at values close to 0. Let's assume \\( f(1) = c \\). Then:\n\\[ f(c + y) \\mid 1 + f(y). \\]\nThis implies that \\( f(c + y) \\) is a divisor of \\( 1 + f(y) \\) for all \\( y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\).\n\n### Step 5: Consider the case when \\( y = c \\)\nSubstitute \\( y = c \\) into the condition:\n\\[ f(c + c) \\mid 1 + f(c). \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ f(2c) \\mid 1 + f(c). \\]\nSince \\( f \\) maps positive integers to positive integers, \\( f(2c) \\) must be a positive divisor of \\( 1 + f(c) \\). The only positive divisors of a positive integer are 1 and the integer itself. Therefore, \\( f(2c) \\) must be either 1 or \\( 1 + f(c) \\).\n\n### Step 6: Consider the case when \\( f \\) is injective\nIf \\( f \\) is injective, then \\( f(c + y) \\) must be distinct for distinct \\( y \\). However, since \\( f(2c) \\) must be a divisor of \\( 1 + f(c) \\), and \\( f \\) is injective, \\( f(2c) \\) cannot be 1 (because \\( f(c) \\) is a positive integer, so \\( 1 + f(c) > 1 \\)). Therefore, \\( f(2c) = 1 + f(c) \\).\n\n### Step 7: Determine the form of \\( f \\)\nIf \\( f(2c) = 1 + f(c) \\), we can try to find a pattern. Let's assume \\( f(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\). Then:\n\\[ f(f(x) + y) = f(x + y) = x + y, \\]\nand\n\\[ x + f(y) = x + y. \\]\nClearly, \\( x + y \\mid x + y \\) is always true. Therefore, \\( f(n) = n \\) satisfies the given condition.\n\n### Step 8: Verify that \\( f(n) = n \\) is the only solution\nAssume there is another function \\( g \\) that satisfies the condition. Since \\( f \\) is injective and \\( f(n) = n \\) works, any other function would need to be injective and satisfy the same divisibility condition. However, the only way to satisfy \\( f(f(x) + y) \\mid x + f(y) \\) for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\) is for \\( f \\) to be the identity function. Any deviation from \\( f(n) = n \\) would violate the condition for some \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nTherefore, the only function \\( f \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(n) = n} \\]"

In this case, the condition simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sum_{c \\in C} W(i,c) W(c,j) = |C| = 1.\n\\]\nSince \\( C = \\{j\\} \\), this reduces to:\n\\[\nW(i,j) W(j,j) = 1.\n\\]\nHowever, since \\( W \\) is defined only for off-diagonal values, \\( W(j,j) \\) does not appear in the function, and we need to consider the general case where \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are not singletons.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when \\( A = \\{i\\} \\), \\( B = \\{i\\} \\), and \\( C = \\{i\\} \\). This is not possible since \\( A, B, C \\) are disjoint, but it suggests that \\( W(i,i) \\) might be zero or undefined. However, since \\( W \\) is only defined for off-diagonal values, we can ignore this case.\n\nTo find a general solution, let's assume \\( W(a,b) = \\frac{1}{W(b,a)} \\) and \\( W(a,a) = 0 \\). We need to check if this form satisfies the original condition. Consider the sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\sum_{b \\in B} \\sum_{c \\in C} W(a,b) W(b,c).\n\\]\nIf we assume \\( W(a,b) = \\frac{1}{W(b,a)} \\) and \\( W(a,a) = 0 \\), then for any \\( a, b, c \\) such that \\( a, b, c \\) are distinct, we have \\( W(a,b) W(b,c) = \\frac{1}{W(b,a)} W(b,c) = \\frac{W(b,c)}{W(b,a)} \\). However, without loss of generality, we can assume \\( W(a,b) = 1 \\) for \\( a \\neq b \\) and \\( W(a,a) = 0 \\). This form satisfies the condition because:\n\\[\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\sum_{b \\in B} \\sum_{c \\in C} W(a,b) W(b,c) = \\sum_{a \\in A} \\sum_{b \\in B} \\sum_{c \\in C} 1 = |A| |B| |C|.\n\\]\nThus, the function \\( W(a,b) = 1 \\) for \\( a \\neq b \\) and \\( W(a,a) = 0 \\) is a solution. We can also consider the function \\( W(a,b) = -1 \\) for \\( a \\neq b \\) and \\( W(a,a) = 0 \\), which also satisfies the condition because:\n\\[\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\sum_{b \\in B} \\sum_{c \\in C} (-1) (-1) = |A| |B| |C|.\n\\]\nTherefore, the solutions are:\n\\[\nW(a,b) = 1 \\text{ for } a \\neq b \\text{ and } W(a,a) = 0,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nW(a,b) = -1 \\text{ for } a \\neq b \\text{ and } W(a,a) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{W(a,b) = 1 \\text{ for } a \\neq b \\text{ and } W(a,a) = 0 \\text{ or } W(a,b) = -1 \\text{ for } a \\neq b \\text{ and } W(a,a) = 0}.\n\\]"

The problem now reduces to finding the minimum number of transfers required to achieve this configuration from any initial configuration.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of transfers, we need to consider the maximum possible imbalance in the initial configuration. The maximum imbalance occurs when the cards are distributed as far apart as possible. The most extreme case is when one person has all the cards numbered from 51 to 101 (51 cards), and the other 50 people have the cards numbered from 1 to 50 (50 cards each). In this case, we need to move 50 cards from each of the 50 people to the person with the 51 cards. This would require:\n\\[\n50 \\times 50 = 2500 \\text{ transfers}\n\\]\nHowever, this is not the only way to achieve the balanced configuration. We can also consider the case where the cards are distributed in a way that minimizes the maximum imbalance. For example, if the cards are distributed such that the difference in the number of cards between any two people is minimized, the number of transfers required will be less than 2500.\n\nTo find the smallest \\( k \\) that guarantees the balanced configuration, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for any initial configuration.

One way to do this is to consider the set of elements that are composed of the smallest primes, ensuring that each element shares at least one prime factor with every other element in the set.\n\nConsider the set of elements that are products of the primes 2, 3, and 5:\n\\[ S = \\{2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 30, 60, 90\\} \\]\n\nLet's check if this set satisfies both conditions:\n1.
