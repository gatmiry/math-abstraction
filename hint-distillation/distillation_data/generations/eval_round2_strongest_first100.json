      "response": "To determine the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on \\( n \\) vertices, we need to analyze the constraints and the construction of such a tournament.\n\nFirst, let's consider the lower bound. A proper directed-edge-coloring of a tournament means that for every pair of directed edges \\(\\overrightarrow{uv}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{vw}\\), those two edges must be in different colors. This implies that at any vertex \\( v \\), a single color cannot appear on both an incoming edge and an outgoing edge through \\( v \\). This suggests that if we fix a color, say red, and look at the set \\( S \\) of tails of red edges, no red edge can lie inside \\( S \\) because otherwise, if \\( x \\rightarrow y \\) is red with \\( y \\in S \\), then \\( y \\rightarrow z \\) must also be red, forming a forbidden monochromatic red 2-path \\( x \\rightarrow y \\rightarrow z \\). Therefore, at least one of \\( S \\) or \\( V \\setminus S \\) has size at least \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\). This means that after removing the vertices in \\( S \\) or \\( V \\setminus S \\), we are left with at least \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\) vertices, and we can use at most \\( c-1 \\) colors on this subtournament. Iterating this process, we can see that after \\( t \\) removals, we are left with at least \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2^t} \\right\\rceil \\) vertices, and we use at most \\( c-t \\) colors. To cover all \\( n \\) vertices, we need \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2^t} \\right\\rceil \\geq 1 \\), which implies \\( 2^t \\geq n \\). Therefore, \\( t \\geq \\left\\lceil \\log_2 n \\right\\rceil \\), and since we use \\( c-t \\) colors, the minimum number of colors \\( c \\) must be at least \\( \\left\\lceil \\log_2 n \\right\\rceil \\).\n\nNext, let's consider the upper bound. We can construct a tournament on \\( n \\) vertices that uses at most \\( \\left\\lceil \\log_2 n \\right\\rceil \\) colors. We can label the vertices from 0 to \\( n-1 \\) in binary with \\( L \\) bits, where \\( L \\) is the smallest integer such that \\( 2^L \\geq n \\). We orient the edges from \\( u \\) to \\( v \\) if the binary representation of \\( v \\) is lexicographically larger than that of \\( u \\). This creates a tournament because every pair of vertices differ in some bit position, and the orientation is consistent. To see that this coloring is proper, note that if \\( u \\rightarrow v \\) and \\( v \\rightarrow w \\) have the same color, then \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) must differ in the same bit position, and \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) must also differ in the same bit position, which implies \\( u \\) and \\( w \\) differ in that bit position, a contradiction. Therefore, this construction uses at most \\( L = \\left\\lceil \\log_2 n \\right\\rceil \\) colors.\n\nSince the lower bound and the upper bound both give us \\( \\left\\lceil \\log_2 n \\right\\rceil \\), we conclude that the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \\( n \\) vertices is \\(\\boxed{\\left\\lceil \\log_2 n \\right\\rceil}\\)."

Let these coefficients be around some large \\(L\\) with tiny distinct perturbations preserving the displayed order.\n\n2. **Analyze the Polynomial for \\(x \\geq 0\\):**\n   For \\(x \\geq 0\\), the polynomial \\(P_t(x) = x^{20} + a_{19}x^{19} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0 + t\\) is positive because all coefficients are positive and the leading term \\(x^{20} > 0\\).\n\n3. **Analyze the Polynomial for \\(x < 0\\):**\n   For \\(x < 0\\), we can write \\(P_t(x) = x^{18}Q_t(x)\\) where \\(Q_t(x) = x^2 + a_{19}x + t + \\cdots + \\frac{a_0}{x^{18}}\\). As \\(x \\to -\\infty\\) or \\(x \\to 0^-\\), \\(Q_t(x) \\to +\\infty\\). Therefore, \\(Q_t(x)\\) has a finite minimum.

If one usamon has an electron and the other does not, the electron jumps from the first usamon to the second.\n   - The physicist cannot observe whether an electron jumps during any given step.\n   - The goal is to isolate two usamons that the physicist is sure are currently in the same state (both have an electron or both do not have an electron).\n\n2. **Modeling the Problem:**\n   - We can represent the state of each usamon as a bit (0 or 1).\n   - The diode operation can be modeled as either leaving the bits unchanged or swapping them in the case (1,0) to (0,1).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Invariants:**\n   - After each diode usage, the physicist's knowledge is a set of configurations consistent with all unobserved possibilities.\n   - The key invariant is that after each step, the knowledge set is precisely all configurations nondecreasing under some order updated by possibly swapping the acted-on indices, retaining only that some order has all 0s before all 1s with no fixed boundary.\n\n4. **Using the Invariant:**\n   - Suppose the physicist wants to isolate two usamons \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that \\( p < q \\).\n   - The boundary between 0s and 1s can be positioned strictly between \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) so that a consistent configuration has \\( x_p = 0 \\) and \\( x_q = 1 \\).\n   - This means that after each diode usage, the physicist can update her knowledge to maintain the invariant that the boundary is between \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n5. **Iterating the Placement:**\n   - By iteratively placing the boundary between \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) and using the diode to update the configuration, the physicist can eventually isolate two usamons that are sure to be in the same state.\n   - This is because the diode operation ensures that the configuration can be updated to maintain the invariant, and the process can be repeated until the desired pair is isolated.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the physicist can isolate two usamons that she is sure are currently in the same state by using a series of diode usage.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\n\\]"

Consider the graph \\( G \\) formed by three disjoint copies of a graph \\( H \\), where \\( H \\) is a 10-vertex graph consisting of two 5-cycles with each vertex in one 5-cycle adjacent to the two adjacent vertices in the other 5-cycle. This graph \\( H \\) has maximum degree 5, no \\( K_5 \\), and an independence number of 3 (since each 5-cycle has an independent set of size 3 and the two 5-cycles are connected in such a way that no larger independent set is possible).\n\nBy taking three disjoint copies of \\( H \\), we form a graph \\( G' \\) with 30 vertices, maximum degree 5, no \\( K_5 \\), and an independence number of \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\). However, this construction shows that the independence number can be as large as 9, but we need to confirm that 6 is the lower bound for all such graphs.\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom the above steps, we have shown that for any graph \\( G \\) with 30 vertices, maximum degree 5, and no \\( K_5 \\), there exists an independent set of size at least 6. Therefore, the maximum \\( k \\) such that for all such possible configurations, there exists \\( k \\) students who are all not friends is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"

      "response": "To find a real number \\( t \\) such that for any set of 120 points \\( P_1, \\ldots, P_{120} \\) on the boundary of a unit square, there exists a point \\( Q \\) on this boundary with \\( |P_1Q| + |P_2Q| + \\cdots + |P_{120}Q| = t \\), we will follow the steps outlined in the partial solution and fill in the details.\n\nFirst, let's consider the function \\( g(Q) = \\sum_{i=1}^{120} |Q P_i| \\) where \\( Q \\) is a point on the boundary of the unit square and \\( P_i \\) are the 120 points on the boundary. Since the boundary of the unit square is a connected set and \\( g(Q) \\) is a continuous function, the set of values \\( g(Q) \\) as \\( Q \\) runs along the boundary is a closed interval.\n\nTo determine the bounds of this interval, we need to consider the minimum and maximum values of \\( g(Q) \\).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the minimum value of \\( g(Q) \\).**\n\nThe minimum value of \\( g(Q) \\) occurs when \\( Q \\) is the centroid of the 120 points. For a set of points on the boundary of a unit square, the centroid is not necessarily on the boundary. However, we can use the fact that the minimum value of \\( g(Q) \\) is at least the perimeter of the unit square divided by 4, which is 1. This is because if we divide the square into four smaller squares, the sum of the distances from any point on the boundary to the points in the same smaller square is at least the perimeter of the smaller square divided by 4, which is 1. Since there are 120 points, the minimum value of \\( g(Q) \\) is at least 1.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the maximum value of \\( g(Q) \\).**\n\nThe maximum value of \\( g(Q) \\) occurs when \\( Q \\) is a point that maximizes the sum of the distances to the 120 points. By symmetry and the properties of the unit square, the maximum value of \\( g(Q) \\) is at most the perimeter of the unit square times 1.5, which is 6. This is because the maximum distance from any point on the boundary to a point in the opposite side is 1.5 (the distance from a corner to the midpoint of the opposite side).\n\nHowever, we can use a more precise bound. The maximum value of \\( g(Q) \\) is actually 120 times the maximum distance from any point on the boundary to a point on the opposite side, which is \\( 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\) (the distance from a corner to the midpoint of the opposite side). Therefore, the maximum value of \\( g(Q) \\) is \\( 120 \\times (1 + \\sqrt{2}) = 120 + 120\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the intermediate value.**\n\nBy the intermediate value theorem, since \\( g(Q) \\) is continuous and the boundary is connected, \\( g(Q) \\) will take on every value between its minimum and maximum values. Therefore, there exists a point \\( Q \\) on the boundary such that \\( g(Q) = 120 \\).\n\nThus, the value of \\( t \\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

This can be done using quantifier elimination in the language of arithmetic.\n   - Let \\( N \\) be a positive integer, for example, \\( N = x \\).\n   - Let \\( S \\) be a strictly positive polynomial on positive inputs, for example, \\( S = 1 + (x + y + z)^2 \\).\n\n4. **Formulating \\( P(x, y, z) \\):**\n   Define the polynomial \\( P(x, y, z) \\) as:\n   \\[\n   P(x, y, z) = N + S \\cdot U(T_0; N, x, y, z)^2\n   \\]\n   - If \\( N \\) is a non-square, then \\( U(T_0; N, x, y, z) = 0 \\) for some \\( (x, y, z) \\). Thus, \\( P(x, y, z) = N \\).\n   - If \\( N \\) is a square, then \\( U(T_0; N, x, y, z) \\neq 0 \\) for any \\( (x, y, z) \\).

Choose \\( (x, y, z) \\) such that \\( N = n \\). Then \\( U(T_0; n, x, y, z) = 0 \\), and thus \\( P(x, y, z) = n \\).\n   - **Square \\( n \\):** If \\( n \\) is a square, then \\( F(n, u) \\neq 0 \\) for any \\( u \\).

It uses three variables \\( x, y, z \\) and has integer coefficients.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P(x, y, z) = x + (1 + (x + y + z)^2) \\cdot U(T_0; x, x, y, z)^2}\n\\]"

Clearly, \\(a = 1\\) divides \\(b^n - n\\) for all \\(n\\) because \\(b^n - n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1}\\). So, \\(a = 1\\) is not a solution.\n\nNext, let's consider the case when \\(a = 2\\). For \\(a = 2\\), we need to check if \\(2\\) divides \\(b^n - n\\) for all \\(n\\). If \\(b\\) is odd, then \\(b^n\\) is also odd, and \\(b^n - n\\) is even because the difference of two odd numbers is even. If \\(b\\) is even, then \\(b^n\\) is even, and \\(b^n - n\\) is even because the difference of two even numbers is even. Therefore, \\(2\\) divides \\(b^n - n\\) for all \\(n\\) when \\(a = 2\\). So, \\(a = 2\\) is not a solution.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when \\(a\\) is a prime power. Suppose \\(a = p^k\\) for some prime \\(p\\) and positive integer \\(k\\). We will use strong induction on \\(a\\) to show that the sequence \\(n_k\\) is eventually constant modulo \\(a\\).\n\n**Base cases:**\n- For \\(a = 1\\), we already know the sequence is eventually constant.\n- For \\(a = 2\\), we already know the sequence is eventually constant.\n\n**Induction hypothesis:**\nAssume that for all \\(a' < a\\), the sequence \\(n_k\\) is eventually constant modulo \\(a'\\).\n\n**Induction step:**\nWe need to show that the sequence \\(n_k\\) is eventually constant modulo \\(a = p^k\\). Consider the sequence modulo \\(p\\). Since \\(p\\) is a prime, by Fermat's Little Theorem, \\(b^p \\equiv b \\pmod{p}\\). Therefore, the sequence \\(n_k\\) modulo \\(p\\) is eventually constant because \\(n_{k+1} \\equiv b^{n_k} \\pmod{p}\\) and \\(n_k\\) will eventually enter a cycle or reach a fixed point modulo \\(p\\).\n\nNow, let \\(a_0 = \\gcd(a, b)\\) and write \\(a = a_0 a_1\\) where \\(\\gcd(a_1, b) = 1\\). By the induction hypothesis, the sequence \\(n_k\\) is eventually constant modulo \\(a_1\\). Let \\(n_{k_1}\\) be the eventual constant value modulo \\(a_1\\). Since \\(a_1\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime, by Euler's theorem, \\(b^{\\phi(a_1)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{a_1}\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the Euler's totient function. Therefore, the sequence \\(n_k\\) modulo \\(a_1\\) is eventually constant, and the dependence \\(n_{k+1} \\equiv b^{n_k \\mod \\phi(a_1)} \\pmod{a_1}\\) implies that \\(n_{k+1}\\) is eventually constant modulo \\(\\phi(a_1)\\). Since \\(\\phi(a_1) < a_1 < a\\), by the induction hypothesis, the sequence \\(n_k\\) is eventually constant modulo \\(\\phi(a_1)\\), and thus modulo \\(a_1\\). Combining eventual constancy modulo \\(a_0\\) and modulo \\(a_1\\) via the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we get that the sequence \\(n_k\\) is eventually constant modulo \\(a\\).\n\nFinally, let \\(n_k\\) be the eventual constant value modulo \\(a\\). Then, for some large \\(k\\), \\(n_{k+1} \\equiv n_k \\pmod{a}\\), which implies \\(b^{n_k} \\equiv n_k \\pmod{a}\\).

      "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find all positive integers \\(a\\) such that there exists a set \\(X\\) of 6 integers satisfying the given conditions. Let's go through the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Problem in Modular Arithmetic:**\n   We work modulo 37 and identify \\(X\\) with a 6-element subset of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{37}\\). The map \\(\\Phi: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{37} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) given by \\(\\Phi(x, y) = ax + y\\) must cover all non-zero residues modulo 37. This means that all 36 values \\(\\Phi(x, y)\\) are distinct and non-zero.\n\n2. **Express the Covering Condition Using Character Sums:**\n   The covering condition can be expressed in terms of character sums. Let \\(\\chi\\) be a non-trivial character modulo 37. The sum \\(S_m = \\sum_{x \\in X} \\chi(mx)\\) must satisfy \\(S_m S_{am} = -1\\) for \\(m \\neq 0\\). This implies that \\(S_{a^2 m} = S_m\\). Therefore, the polynomial \\(P(z)\\) defined by \\(P(z) = \\sum_{x \\in X} z^x\\) satisfies \\(P(z^{a^2}) \\equiv P(z) \\pmod{z^{37} - 1}\\). This means that \\(a^2 X = X\\) as sets, and \\(0 \\notin X\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Possible Cycles:**\n   Since \\(a^2 X = X\\), the set \\(X\\) is a union of cycles of length \\(d\\) where \\(d\\) is a divisor of 6. The possible values for \\(d\\) are 1, 2, 3, and 6. However, \\(d = 1\\) is impossible because it would imply \\(a \\equiv 1\\) or \\(a \\equiv -1\\), neither of which can satisfy the conditions. Similarly, \\(d = 3\\) is impossible because it would imply \\(a^3 \\equiv -1\\), which is not possible modulo 37. Therefore, the only possible value for \\(d\\) is 2.\n\n4. **Verify \\(d = 2\\):**\n   If \\(d = 2\\), then \\(X\\) is a union of cycles of length 2. This means that \\(a^2 X = X\\) and \\(a^4 X = X\\). We can take \\(X\\) to be the set of 6th powers modulo 37, and \\(aX\\) to be a coset of cubes not consisting of 6th powers. A direct residue computation shows that there is a collision in \\(aX + X\\), which contradicts the injectivity of \\(\\Phi\\). Therefore, the only possibility is that \\(d = 2\\), which means \\(a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}\\) and \\(a \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}\\).\n\n5. **Find the Solutions:**\n   The solutions to \\(a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}\\) are \\(a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}\\) and \\(a \\equiv -1 \\pmod{37}\\). Since \\(a \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{37}\\), the only solution is \\(a \\equiv -1 \\pmod{37}\\). Therefore, the only positive integer \\(a\\) that satisfies the conditions is \\(a = 36\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]"

We need to pick 150 entries such that the sum of entries in each row and each column is at least \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n### Step 2: Using the\u63d0\u793a\nThe hint suggests finding a 50-matching in \\(G_{\\ge t}\\) with \\(t \\le \\frac{1}{100}\\) and then completing the remaining rows and columns within the 150-pick budget. We need to ensure that the sum of the entries in each row and each column is at least \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring a 50-matching\nTo ensure a 50-matching in \\(G_{\\ge t}\\), we use the following inequality:\n\\[ |S| < |N(S)| + (100 - |N(S)|) |S| t \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ |S| < |N(S)| + (100 - |N(S)|) t \\]\nFor \\(|N(S)| \\le |S| - 51\\), we have:\n\\[ |S| < |S| - 51 + (100 - (|S| - 51)) t \\]\n\\[ |S| < |S| - 51 + (151 - |S|) t \\]\n\\[ |S| < |S| t + 151 t - 51 t \\]\n\\[ |S| < |S| t + 100 t \\]\n\\[ |S| (1 - t) < 100 t \\]\n\\[ |S| < \\frac{100 t}{1 - t} \\]\nSince \\(t \\le \\frac{1}{100}\\), we have:\n\\[ |S| < \\frac{100 \\cdot \\frac{1}{100}}{1 - \\frac{1}{100}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{99}{100}} = \\frac{100}{99} \\]\nSince \\(|S|\\) must be an integer, we have:\n\\[ |S| \\le 1 \\]\nThis means we can find a 50-matching in \\(G_{\\ge t}\\) with \\(t \\le \\frac{1}{100}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Completing the Remaining Rows and Columns\nAfter finding a 50-matching, we have 50 matched entries. We then pick one maximal entry from each of the remaining 50 rows and one maximal entry from each of the remaining 50 columns. Since each row and each column has an entry \\(\\ge \\frac{1}{100}\\), the sum of the entries in each row and each column will be at least \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\).\n\nThe total number of picks is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ (matched entries)} + 50 \\text{ (maximal entries in remaining rows)} + 50 \\text{ (maximal entries in remaining columns)} = 150 \\]\nThus, the sum of the entries in each row and each column is at least \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Showing No Larger Threshold Works\nTo show that no larger threshold works, consider a 4-block doubly stochastic matrix with a 25x24 zero top-left block, a 75x24 block of equal positives, a 25x76 block of equal positives, and a 75x76 block of a uniform smaller value chosen to make all row/column sums equal 1.

      "response": "To determine the maximum number of edges of a regular octahedron that can be seen from a point outside the octahedron, we will follow the steps outlined in the problem and the hint provided.\n\n1. **Model the Regular Octahedron:**\n   The regular octahedron can be realized as the convex body \\( |x| + |y| + |z| \\leq 1 \\) with vertices at \\( A_1 = (0,0,1) \\), \\( A_2 = (0,0,-1) \\), \\( B_1 = (0,1,0) \\), \\( B_2 = (0,-1,0) \\), \\( C_1 = (1,0,0) \\), and \\( C_2 = (-1,0,0) \\).\n\n2. **Define the Point \\( P \\):**\n   Let \\( P = (x_0, y_0, z_0) \\) be a point outside the octahedron. By symmetry, we can assume \\( x_0, y_0, z_0 \\geq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Visibility of Edges:**\n   An edge \\( AB \\) is visible from \\( P \\) if the plane through \\( P \\) and \\( AB \\) intersects the octahedron only in the segment \\( AB \\). This is equivalent to the plane not slicing through the dihedral wedge defined by the incident face planes.\n\n4. **Represent the Octahedron by Face Planes:**\n   The octahedron is defined by the eight face planes \\( \\pm x \\pm y \\pm z = 1 \\). The interior half-spaces are given by \\( \\sigma_1 x + \\sigma_2 y + \\sigma_3 z \\leq 1 \\), where \\( \\sigma_i \\) are either \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\).\n\n5. **Non-Visibility Test:**\n   If \\( P \\) is in the interior half-space of either incident face, the plane through \\( P \\) and the edge slices the wedge and intersects the solid in more than the edge. Therefore, we need to ensure \\( P \\) is not in the interior half-space of either incident face.\n\n6. **Apply the Non-Visibility Test:**\n   - For edges through \\( A_2 \\): \\( x_0 + y_0 \\leq 1 + z_0 \\)\n   - For edges through \\( B_2 \\): \\( y_0 + z_0 \\leq 1 + x_0 \\)\n   - For edges through \\( C_2 \\): \\( z_0 + x_0 \\leq 1 + y_0 \\)\n\n   If these inequalities hold, then the plane through \\( P \\) and the edge is supporting, and the edge is visible.\n\n7. **Maximize Visibility:**\n   To maximize the number of visible edges, we need to impose the strict inequalities:\n   \\[\n   x_0 + y_0 > 1 + z_0, \\quad y_0 + z_0 > 1 + x_0, \\quad z_0 + x_0 > 1 + y_0\n   \\]\n\n   Under these strict inequalities, every edge incident to at least one of \\( A_1, B_1, C_1 \\) has \\( P \\) on the exterior side of both incident face half-spaces, making the plane supporting and the edge visible.\n\n8. **Count the Visible Edges:**\n   - The octahedron has 12 edges.\n   - The edges incident to \\( A_1, B_1, C_1 \\) are \\( A_1B_1, A_1C_1, B_1C_1 \\) and their opposites \\( A_2B_2, B_2C_2, C_2A_2 \\).\n   - Under the strict inequalities, the edges \\( A_2B_2, B_2C_2, C_2A_2 \\) are not visible.\n   - Therefore, the visible edges are \\( A_1B_1, A_1C_1, B_1C_1, A_1B_2, A_1C_2, B_1C_2, B_2C_1, C_2A_1, C_2B_1 \\).\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   The maximum number of edges that can be seen from a point outside the octahedron is 9.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Conditions\nThe conditions are:\n1. \\( m > 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\).\n2. The numbers \\( P(0), P^2(0), \\ldots, P^{m-1}(0) \\) are not divisible by \\( n \\).\n3. \\( P^m(0) \\) is divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Interpreting the Conditions Dynamically Modulo \\( n \\)\nThe conditions imply that 0 lies on a cycle of exact length \\( m \\) in the functional graph of \\( x \\mapsto P(x) \\) on \\( \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\). This means:\n- \\( P^k(0) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\) for \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq m-1 \\).\n- \\( P^m(0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the cycle length of 0 modulo \\( n \\) is the least common multiple of its cycle lengths modulo each \\( p_i^{a_i} \\) where \\( n = \\prod p_i^{a_i} \\). Therefore, we need to control the cycle length of 0 modulo \\( p_i^{a_i} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Lifting Lemma\nWe need to prove that every cycle length modulo \\( p^t \\) is \\( p \\)-smooth. This means that the period can increase by at most a factor of \\( p \\) when passing from \\( p^{t-1} \\) to \\( p^t \\).\n\n### Step 5: Necessity\nAssume \\( n \\) has the prime divisors \\( \\{2, 3, \\ldots, p_k\\} \\). Since \\( m > 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\), there exists a prime \\( p_i \\) such that \\( p_i \\mid m \\). This implies \\( m \\) is not \\( p \\)-smooth, which contradicts the condition that the cycle length is \\( p \\)-smooth. Therefore, \\( n \\) cannot have all primes from \\( \\{2, 3, \\ldots, p_k\\} \\).\n\n### Step 6: Sufficiency\nAssume \\( n \\) does not have all primes from \\( \\{2, 3, \\ldots, p_k\\} \\). Let \\( p \\) be the largest prime dividing \\( n \\) and write \\( n = p^t \\cdot N \\) with \\( p \\nmid N \\). Choose a prime \\( q < p \\) with \\( q \\nmid n \\). Set \\( m = q \\).\n\n### Step 7: Constructing the Polynomial \\( P(x) \\)\nConstruct \\( Q(x) \\) modulo \\( p^t \\) by choosing distinct residues \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{q-1} \\mod p \\) with \\( x_0 = x_q = 0 \\) and using Lagrange interpolation to ensure \\( Q(x_i) \\equiv x_{i+1} \\mod p^t \\). This gives a \\( q \\)-cycle modulo \\( p^t \\).\n\n### Step 8: Lifting \\( Q(x) \\) to \\( P(x) \\)\nLift \\( Q(x) \\) to a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) modulo \\( n \\) by choosing coefficients \\( b_j \\) such that \\( b_j \\equiv \\text{coeff}_j(Q) \\mod p^t \\) and \\( b_j \\equiv 0 \\mod N \\) via CRT. This ensures \\( P \\equiv Q \\mod p^t \\) and \\( P \\equiv 0 \\mod N \\).\n\n### Step 9: Verifying the Conditions\nFor \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq q-1 \\), verify that \\( P^k(0) \\) is divisible by \\( N \\) but not by \\( p^t \\) (hence not by \\( n \\)). For \\( k = q \\), verify that \\( P^q(0) \\) is divisible by both \\( N \\) and \\( p^t \\) (hence by \\( n \\)).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe conditions are satisfied if and only if \\( n \\) does not have all primes from \\( \\{2, 3, \\ldots, p_k\\} \\). Therefore, the integers \\( n \\geq 2 \\) that satisfy the conditions are those that do not include all primes from \\( \\{2, 3, \\ldots, p_k\\} \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{All integers } n \\geq 2 \\text{ that do not have all primes from } \\{2, 3, \\ldots, p_k\\}}\n\\]"

This is a classic application of the Erd\u0151s-Szekeres theorem in the context of the Boolean lattice.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are working with the Boolean lattice of all subsets of a set \\( X \\) with 100 elements. We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that any sequence of \\( n \\) subsets contains a monotone 3-term chain.\n\n### Step 2: Lower Bound\nWe can construct a sequence of subsets that avoids a monotone 3-term chain. Consider the following construction:\n- Divide the 100 elements into two groups of 50 and 50 elements.\n- Create two blocks of subsets: one block with subsets of size 50 and another block with subsets of size 49.\n- The total number of subsets in each block is \\( \\binom{100}{50} \\) and \\( \\binom{100}{49} \\), respectively.\n- The total length of this sequence is \\( 2 \\binom{100}{50} + 2 \\binom{100}{49} \\).\n\nThis sequence avoids a monotone 3-term chain because:\n- Subsets within the same block are not comparable (one is not a subset of the other).\n- Subsets from different blocks are comparable (a subset of size 49 is a subset of a subset of size 50).\n\n### Step 3: Upper Bound\nWe need to show that any sequence of length greater than \\( 2 \\binom{100}{50} + 2 \\binom{100}{49} \\) must contain a monotone 3-term chain. To do this, we use the concept of a 2-Sperner family:\n- A family of subsets is 2-Sperner if it does not contain a chain of length 3.\n- The largest 2-Sperner family in the Boolean lattice of 100 elements is the family of all subsets of size 50 and the family of all subsets of size 49.\n\nThe size of each of these families is \\( \\binom{100}{50} \\) and \\( \\binom{100}{49} \\), respectively.

Therefore, the smallest \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\nn = 2 \\binom{100}{50} + 2 \\binom{100}{49} + 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 \\binom{100}{50} + 2 \\binom{100}{49} + 1}\n\\]"

      "response": "To determine the least possible number of birds on the circle with the most birds, we will follow the steps outlined in the partial solution and fill in the details.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find the minimum number of birds, \\( m \\), that can lie on a circle such that for any group of 5 birds, at least 4 of them lie on some circle.\n\n2. **Upper Bound:**\n   Consider the configuration where 9 birds are on a circle and 1 bird is not on that circle. For any group of 5 birds, at least 4 of them will be among the 9 birds on the circle, and thus will be concyclic. This configuration satisfies the condition.\n\n3. **Lower Bound:**\n   We need to show that \\( m \\) cannot be less than 9. Assume for contradiction that \\( m \\leq 8 \\). Let's consider a circle \\( C \\) with 8 birds and two birds \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) outside \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Graph Construction:**\n   Construct a graph \\( G \\) on the 8 birds of \\( C \\) where there is an edge \\( XY \\) if there is a circle through \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( X \\), and \\( Y \\). The graph \\( G \\) must be triangle-free because for any triple \\( S \\subset C \\), the 5-set \\( S \\cup \\{A, B\\} \\) must contain 4 concyclic points. This implies that either \\( A \\in C \\) or \\( B \\in C \\) or a circle through \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) that also passes through two members of \\( S \\).\n\n5. **Tur\u00e1n's Theorem:**\n   By Tur\u00e1n's theorem, a triangle-free graph on 8 vertices has at most 16 edges. Since \\( K_8 \\) has 28 edges, the graph \\( G \\) must have at least \\( 28 - 16 = 12 \\) edges. However, geometrically, for any fixed \\( X \\in C \\), the circle through \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( X \\) meets \\( C \\) again in at most one other point \\( Y \\), so \\( \\deg(X) \\leq 1 \\) and thus \\( |E(G)| \\leq 4 \\). This is a contradiction because \\( |E(G)| \\) cannot be both at least 12 and at most 4.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The contradiction implies that our assumption \\( m \\leq 8 \\) is false. Therefore, the minimum number of birds on the circle with the most birds is \\( m = 9 \\).\n\nThus, the least possible number of birds on the circle with the most birds is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."

The goal is to maximize the number of even entries after a series of moves, where each move toggles the parities of all entries in a row and a column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Move:**\n   Each move toggles the parities of all entries in a chosen row and column. This means that each move affects \\( 2n-1 \\) entries.\n\n2. **Parity Toggling:**\n   We need to understand how to use these moves to control the parities of the entries. Specifically, we want to flip the parities of as many entries as possible to even (0 modulo 2).\n\n3. **Constructing the Operation:**\n   For even \\( n \\), we can use a permutation set to toggle exactly \\( n \\) prescribed cells. The set \\( S_k = \\{(1,1), (k,1), (1,k)\\} \\cup \\{(t,t) : t \\in \\{2, \\ldots, n\\}, t \\neq k\\} \\) for \\( k = 2, \\ldots, n \\) allows us to toggle the parities of the cells in such a way that we can control the parities of the entire board.\n\n4. **Implementing the Permutation Set:**\n   By applying the permutation set toggles, we can achieve any desired parity configuration on the board. This means we can adjust the parities of the entire board to have as many even entries as possible.\n\n5. **Maximizing the Number of Even Entries:**\n   For even \\( n \\), we can achieve a configuration where all entries are even, except for the entry at the intersection of the first row and first column. This means we can have \\( n^2 - 1 \\) even entries.\n\n6. **For Odd \\( n \\):**\n   For odd \\( n \\), each cross toggles all row and column parities. We can start with a parity matrix where the first row and first column have alternating parities, and the rest of the matrix has the opposite parity. This means that in any state, at least \\( n-1 \\) columns have odd sum, so at least \\( n-1 \\) entries are odd. Therefore, the maximum number of even entries is \\( n^2 - (n-1) = n^2 - n + 1 \\).\n\n7. **Combining the Results:**\n   - For even \\( n \\), the maximum number of even entries is \\( n^2 - 1 \\).\n   - For odd \\( n \\), the maximum number of even entries is \\( n^2 - n + 1 \\).\n\nThus, the largest \\( N(n) \\) is given by:\n\\[ N(n) = \\begin{cases} \nn^2 - 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\\nn^2 - n + 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\n\\]"

Since each block has at most \\( t \\) colors, we have:\n\\[ k \\leq \\frac{n}{t} \\]\nIn this construction, the maximum size of a color-identifiable set is \\( k \\), which is exactly \\( \\frac{n}{t} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the maximum integer \\( g(n, t) \\) such that in any sports league with exactly \\( n \\) distinct colors present over all teams, one can always find a color-identifiable set of size at least \\( g(n, t) \\) is:\n\\[ g(n, t) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{t} \\right\\rceil \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{t} \\right\\rceil}\n\\]"

      "response": "To solve the problem of finding the maximal possible number of edges in a simple graph \\( G \\) with 100 vertices such that for each vertex \\( u \\), there exists a vertex \\( v \\in N(u) \\) with \\( N(u) \\cap N(v) = \\emptyset \\), we will follow the steps outlined in the hint and verify the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to maximize the number of edges in a graph \\( G \\) with 100 vertices where each vertex has at least one neighbor such that the intersection of their neighborhoods is empty. This means that the graph cannot contain any triangles, as any triangle would violate the condition \\( N(u) \\cap N(v) = \\emptyset \\) for some vertices \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in the triangle.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing the Graph\nTo maximize the number of edges, we can use a star forest structure. A star forest is a graph where each connected component is a star, i.e., a central vertex connected to all other vertices in its component, and there are no edges between the components.\n\nLet's divide the 100 vertices into 8 classes, each containing as close to \\( \\frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \\) vertices as possible. Since we can't have half a vertex, we will have 7 classes with 13 vertices and 1 class with 12 vertices. Let's denote the classes as \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_8 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Creating the Star Forest\nFor each class \\( C_i \\), choose a center vertex \\( c_i \\) and connect it to all other vertices in the class. This forms a star for each class. The total number of edges in the star forest is:\n\\[\n7 \\times 12 + 12 = 84 + 12 = 96\n\\]\nThis is because each of the 7 classes with 13 vertices contributes 12 edges (since the center is connected to 12 other vertices), and the class with 12 vertices contributes 11 edges.\n\n### Step 4: Adding Edges Between Centers and Leaves\nNext, we add edges between the centers of the classes. Since there are 8 centers, the number of edges between the centers is:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = 28\n\\]\nThis is because we are choosing 2 out of 8 centers to form an edge.\n\n### Step 5: Adding Edges Between Leaves in Different Classes\nFinally, we add edges between the leaves in different classes. There are \\( 7 \\times 12 + 11 = 84 + 11 = 95 \\) leaves in total. The number of edges between the leaves in different classes is:\n\\[\n95 \\times 7 = 665\n\\]\nThis is because each of the 95 leaves can be connected to 7 centers (one from each of the other 7 classes).\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Condition\nWe need to verify that the condition \\( N(u) \\cap N(v) = \\emptyset \\) is satisfied for each vertex \\( u \\). For a vertex \\( u \\) in class \\( C_i \\), its neighbors are the 12 other vertices in \\( C_i \\) and the center \\( c_i \\). For a vertex \\( v \\) in class \\( C_j \\) (where \\( j \\neq i \\)), \\( N(u) \\cap N(v) = \\{ c_i \\} \\cap \\{ c_j \\} = \\emptyset \\) because \\( c_i \\) and \\( c_j \\) are the centers of different stars and thus not connected to each other. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Total Number of Edges\nThe total number of edges in the graph is the sum of the edges in the star forest, the edges between the centers, and the edges between the leaves in different classes:\n\\[\n96 + 28 + 665 = 789\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximal possible number of edges in \\( G \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{789}\n\\]"

We need to show that this monoid is cofinal in \\( \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\), meaning that for any \\( a, b \\ge 2 \\), there exist \\( A, B \\in M \\) such that \\( aA = bB \\). We can prove this by descending on primes: let \\( P \\) be the largest prime dividing \\( ab \\). Using \\( \\varphi(P^{3t}) = P^{3t-1}(P-1) \\), we can raise the \\( P \\)-adic valuations on both sides by arbitrarily large integers because the set \\( \\{3t-1 : t \\ge 1\\} \\) contains 2 and 5 and thus generates all sufficiently large integers.

Since \\( K = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r \\) and \\( K^n \\) is the maximum possible number, the initial multiset can be split into complementary pairs plus at most one anchor \\( \\alpha \\) dividing \\( P^{n/2} \\) (where \\( P = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r \\) and \\( n/2 \\) is considered for even \\( n \\)).\n\n### Step 2: Alice's Strategy\nAlice's goal is to maintain the structure of complementary pairs plus at most one anchor. She can do this by taking the gcd of a complementary pair \\( (x, K/x) \\), which results in 1, and then combining it with another number to form a new complementary pair. This ensures that the structure is preserved, and the anchor remains a divisor of \\( P^{n/2} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Bob's Strategy\nBob's strategy is to take the lcm of a complementary pair \\( (x, K/x) \\), which results in \\( K \\), and then combine it with another number to form a new complementary pair. This will also preserve the structure, and the anchor remains a divisor of \\( P^{n/2} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Endgame\nAs the game progresses, the number of numbers on the blackboard decreases. Eventually, only one number remains. Since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, the remaining number will be the product of the smallest possible exponents for each prime \\( p_j \\). The smallest exponent for each prime \\( p_j \\) that can be guaranteed is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nThus, the remaining number will be \\( P^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe minimal possible \\( M \\) such that Alice could guarantee the remaining number no greater than \\( M \\), regardless of Bob's move, is \\( P^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}}\n\\]"

Since 503 is a prime number, it must divide the left-hand side of the equation. If 503 were to divide \\( x \\), then \\( 503 \\) would not divide \\( xyz + 2 \\) because \\( 503 \\) would divide \\( xyz \\) but not \\( 2 \\). Therefore, 503 does not divide \\( x \\). This means that 503 must divide \\( y^3 + z^3 \\). Since 503 is a prime and does not divide \\( x \\), we can use the fact that the map \\( t \\rightarrow t^3 \\) is a bijection on the nonzero residues modulo 503.

For a fixed \\( m \\), the left-hand side \\( f(m+n)f(m-n) \\) is independent of \\( n \\) for \\( 1 \\leq n < m \\). This implies that \\( f(m+n) = \\frac{A_m}{f(m-n)} \\) for some constant \\( A_m \\).

      "response": "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given functional equation and the conditions. The function \\( f \\) satisfies:\n1. \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n2. \\( 3f(n)f(2n+1) = f(2n)(1 + 3f(n)) \\)\n3. \\( f(2n) < 6f(n) \\)\n\nFirst, we will use the second condition to derive a relationship between \\( f(2n) \\) and \\( f(n) \\). From the equation \\( 3f(n)f(2n+1) = f(2n)(1 + 3f(n)) \\), we can see that \\( f(2n) \\) must be divisible by \\( 3f(n) \\). Let's denote \\( f(2n) = 3f(n) \\) and \\( f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1 \\). This satisfies the equation because:\n\\[ 3f(n)(3f(n) + 1) = 3f(n)(1 + 3f(n)) \\]\nwhich is true.\n\nNext, we need to check if this satisfies the third condition \\( f(2n) < 6f(n) \\). Since \\( f(2n) = 3f(n) \\), we have \\( 3f(n) < 6f(n) \\), which is true. Therefore, \\( f(2n) = 3f(n) \\) and \\( f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1 \\) are valid for all \\( n \\).\n\nNow, we need to find all solutions to the equation \\( f(k) + f(l) = 293 \\) where \\( k < l \\). We start by expressing 293 in base 3:\n\\[ 293_{10} = 101212_3 \\]\nThis means:\n\\[ 293 = 1 \\cdot 3^5 + 0 \\cdot 3^4 + 1 \\cdot 3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3^2 + 1 \\cdot 3^1 + 2 \\cdot 3^0 \\]\nWe need to split the digits of 293 into two sets of digits such that the sum of the digits in each set is a valid \\( f(n) \\).

The digit sum \\( 101_3 = 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\cdot 3^1 + 1 \\cdot 3^0 = 9 + 0 + 1 = 10 \\), so \\( f(10) = 10 \\).
