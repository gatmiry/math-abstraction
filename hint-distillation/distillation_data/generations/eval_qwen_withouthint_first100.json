Let's analyze the conditions step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Conditions\n1. For every \\( 1 \\le i, j \\le n \\), \\( x_{ij} = \\max\\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ij}\\} \\) or \\( x_{ij} = \\max\\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\ldots, x_{ij}\\} \\).\n2. For every \\( 1 \\le i \\le n \\), there are at most \\( m \\) indices \\( k \\) with \\( x_{ik} = \\max\\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\} \\).\n3. For every \\( 1 \\le j \\le n \\), there are at most \\( m \\) indices \\( k \\) with \\( x_{kj} = \\max\\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\ldots, x_{kj}\\} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Interpreting the Conditions\nWe can interpret the conditions in terms of \"running maxima\":\n- A cell \\( x_{ij} \\) is \"horizontal\" if it is the maximum in its row up to column \\( j \\).\n- A cell \\( x_{ij} \\) is \"vertical\" if it is the maximum in its column up to row \\( i \\).\n\nCondition (1) states that every cell is either horizontal or vertical. Conditions (2) and (3) bound the number of times a cell can be a running maximum in its row or column.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing a Lower Bound for \\( m \\)\nTo find a lower bound for \\( m \\), consider the following:\n- In any row, there must be at least one horizontal maximum.\n- In any column, there must be at least one vertical maximum.\n\nSince there are \\( n \\) rows and \\( n \\) columns, and each row and each column must have at least one maximum, we need at least \\( n \\) horizontal maxima and \\( n \\) vertical maxima. However, a cell can be both a horizontal and a vertical maximum, so we need to avoid double-counting.\n\nTo avoid double-counting, consider the worst-case scenario where each cell is either a horizontal or a vertical maximum, but not both. In this case, we can have at most \\( n \\) horizontal maxima and \\( n \\) vertical maxima, but each cell can only be counted once. Therefore, the total number of maxima is at most \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the minimum \\( m \\) must be at least \\( \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil \\), because each row and each column can have at most \\( m \\) maxima, and we need to ensure that the total number of maxima is at least \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing an Example\nTo show that \\( m = \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil \\) is achievable, consider the following construction:\n- For \\( n \\) even, say \\( n = 2k \\), we can construct an array where each row has \\( k \\) horizontal maxima and each column has \\( k \\) vertical maxima.\n- For \\( n \\) odd, say \\( n = 2k + 1 \\), we can construct an array where each row has \\( k \\) horizontal maxima and each column has \\( k \\) vertical maxima, with one additional cell being both a horizontal and a vertical maximum.\n\nIn both cases, the total number of maxima is \\( n \\), and each row and each column has at most \\( \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil \\) maxima.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum \\( m \\) such that there exists an \\( n \\times n \\) array \\( x_{ij} \\) satisfying the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil}\n\\]"

Let's denote the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number by \\( \\chi(n) \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - A tournament is a directed graph where every pair of vertices has a single directed edge.\n   - A proper directed-edge-coloring assigns colors to the edges such that for every vertex \\( v \\), no color appears on both an incoming edge and an outgoing edge from \\( v \\).\n\n2. **Base Case:**\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\), there are no edges, so \\( \\chi(1) = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Recursive Structure:**\n   - Consider a tournament on \\( n \\) vertices. Fix a vertex \\( v \\). The edges incident to \\( v \\) (i.e., the edges from \\( v \\) to other vertices and from other vertices to \\( v \\)) must be colored such that no two edges of the same color form a directed 2-path through \\( v \\).\n   - This means that the edges from \\( v \\) to other vertices must use different colors, and the edges from other vertices to \\( v \\) must use different colors. Importantly, the colors used for the edges from \\( v \\) to other vertices are distinct from the colors used for the edges from other vertices to \\( v \\).\n\n4. **Induction Hypothesis:**\n   - Assume that for any tournament on \\( k \\) vertices, the minimum number of colors needed is \\( \\chi(k) \\).\n   - For a tournament on \\( n \\) vertices, remove the vertex \\( v \\). The remaining subtournament on \\( n-1 \\) vertices can be colored with \\( \\chi(n-1) \\) colors. Now, we need to color the edges incident to \\( v \\).\n\n5. **Coloring the Edges Incident to \\( v \\):**\n   - The edges from \\( v \\) to other vertices can be colored using \\( \\chi(n-1) \\) colors (since there are no restrictions from the other vertices).\n   - Similarly, the edges from other vertices to \\( v \\) can be colored using \\( \\chi(n-1) \\) colors.\n   - Since the colors used for the edges from \\( v \\) to other vertices must be distinct from the colors used for the edges from other vertices to \\( v \\), we need an additional color for each set of edges. Therefore, we need \\( 2 \\chi(n-1) \\) colors in total for the edges incident to \\( v \\).\n\n6. **Combining the Results:**\n   - The minimum number of colors needed for the entire tournament on \\( n \\) vertices is \\( \\chi(n) = 2 \\chi(n-1) \\).\n\n7. **Base Case for Recurrence:**\n   - We already know \\( \\chi(1) = 0 \\).\n\n8. **Solving the Recurrence:**\n   - Using the recurrence relation \\( \\chi(n) = 2 \\chi(n-1) \\) and the base case \\( \\chi(1) = 0 \\), we can compute:\n     \\[\n     \\chi(2) = 2 \\chi(1) = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\chi(3) = 2 \\chi(2) = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\chi(4) = 2 \\chi(3) = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\chi(n) = 2 \\chi(n-1) = 2^0 = 1 \\text{ for } n \\geq 2\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on \\( n \\) vertices is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

Specifically, we can choose \\(a_{19} < a_{17} < \\ldots < a_1 < a_0 < a_{2} < a_{4} < \\ldots < a_{16}\\) and let these coefficients be very close to each other, but not equal. For example, let \\(a_i = L + \\epsilon_i\\) where \\(L\\) is a large positive number and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) are small distinct positive numbers such that the order is preserved.\n\n2. **Analyze the Polynomial for \\(x \\geq 0\\):**\n   For \\(x \\geq 0\\), the polynomial \\(P(x) = x^{20} + a_{19}x^{19} + \\ldots + a_1x + a_0\\) is positive because all coefficients \\(a_i\\) are positive and the leading term \\(x^{20}\\) is positive.\n\n3. **Analyze the Polynomial for \\(x < 0\\):**\n   For \\(x < 0\\), the term \\(x^{20}\\) is positive, and the other terms \\(a_{19}x^{19}, \\ldots, a_1x\\) are negative. However, since \\(a_{19} < a_{17} < \\ldots < a_1 < a_0\\), the sum of these negative terms will be dominated by the positive term \\(x^{20}\\) for sufficiently large \\(L\\). Therefore, \\(P(x)\\) will be positive for all \\(x < 0\\) as well.\n\n4. **Conclusion for the Original Polynomial:**\n   Since \\(P(x)\\) is positive for all real \\(x\\), it does not have any real roots.\n\n5. **Consider Swapping Coefficients:**\n   Now, consider swapping any two coefficients \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_j\\).

For \\(x = -1\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   P'(-1) = 1 - a_0 + a_{19} - a_{18} + a_{17} - \\ldots + a_1 - a_{18}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(a_{19} > a_{18}\\), the term \\(a_{19} - a_{18}\\) is positive. The other terms \\(1 - a_0, a_{17} - a_{18}, \\ldots, a_1 - a_{18}\\) will be negative, but the positive term \\(a_{19} - a_{18}\\) will dominate, making \\(P'(-1) > 0\\). However, if we choose \\(a_{18}\\) to be very small, we can ensure that the sum of the negative terms can be made smaller than the positive term, so \\(P'(-1) < 0\\). This means \\(P'(x)\\) has a real root at \\(x = -1\\).\n\n6. **Generalization:**\n   By similar reasoning, swapping any two coefficients will result in a polynomial that has a real root. Therefore, the conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\n\\]"

For the condition \\( a_{ij} = u_i + v_j \\) to hold, the difference between any two entries in the same row or column must be a multiple of \\( p \\).

Therefore, each row and each column must contain all the residues modulo \\( p \\) exactly once.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Matrix\nGiven that each row and each column must contain all residues modulo \\( p \\), we can construct the matrix \\( A \\) such that:\n\\[ a_{ij} \\equiv i + j \\pmod{p} \\]\nfor \\( i, j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\} \\).

The term \\(5^z \\cdot 7^w\\) is always odd because 5 and 7 are odd numbers. Therefore, \\(2^x \\cdot 3^y\\) must be odd, which implies \\(x = 0\\). So, we have:\n\\[3^y - 5^z \\cdot 7^w = 1.\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze modulo 3\nNow we consider the equation \\(3^y - 5^z \\cdot 7^w = 1\\) modulo 3. Since \\(3^y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\) for \\(y > 0\\) and \\(3^0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), we have:\n\\[3^y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies 5^z \\cdot 7^w \\equiv -1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}.\\]\nSince \\(5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\) and \\(7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), we get:\n\\[2^z \\cdot 1^w \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\implies 2^z \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}.\\]\nThis implies \\(z = 1\\) because \\(2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\) and \\(2^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), and higher powers of 2 will cycle through 2 and 1. So, we have:\n\\[y = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z = 1.\\]\nThe equation now simplifies to:\n\\[1 - 5 \\cdot 7^w = 1 \\implies 5 \\cdot 7^w = 0.\\]\nThis is impossible for nonnegative integers \\(w\\), so we need to check if there are any other possible values for \\(w\\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze modulo 5\nWe now consider the equation \\(3^y - 5^z \\cdot 7^w = 1\\) modulo 5. Since \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\), the powers of 3 modulo 5 repeat every 4 terms: \\(3, 4, 2, 1\\). Also, \\(7 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\) and \\(2^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\), so the powers of 7 modulo 5 repeat every 4 terms: \\(2, 4, 3, 1\\). Since \\(z = 1\\), we have:\n\\[3^y - 5 \\cdot 7^w \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3^y - 2 \\cdot 7^w \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\\]\nSince \\(7^w \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\) when \\(w = 1\\) and \\(7^w \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\\) when \\(w = 2\\), we need to check these cases:\n1. If \\(w = 1\\), then \\(7^w \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\) and the equation becomes:\n\\[3^y - 2 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3^y - 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3^y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}.\\]\nThis is impossible because 3 is not divisible by 5.\n2. If \\(w = 2\\), then \\(7^w \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\\) and the equation becomes:\n\\[3^y - 2 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3^y - 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3^y - 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies 3^y \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}.\\]\nSince the powers of 3 modulo 5 are \\(3, 4, 2, 1\\), we see that \\(3^y \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\\) when \\(y = 3\\).

Therefore, the smallest \\( m \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( m = 35 \\).\n\nThis is because in a set of 35 elements, the maximum distance between any two elements (in terms of mappings) is 34. If we have 35 mappings, we can always find a sequence of 35 mappings that will map any two elements to the same element. This is because after 34 mappings, we will have mapped the elements to the same element, and the 35th mapping will not change this.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( m \\) such that if \\( F \\) satisfies property \\( P(2019) \\), then it also satisfies property \\( P(m) \\) is \\(\\boxed{35}\\)."

These lines intersect to form vertices. The number of vertices is given by the number of intersection points of these lines. If there are \\(h\\) horizontal lines and \\(v\\) vertical lines, then the number of vertices is \\((h-1)(v-1) + h + v - 1 = 2017\\).\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Vertices\nThe vertices can be of three types: 2, 3, or 4. Let \\(s_2\\), \\(s_3\\), and \\(s_4\\) be the number of vertices of types 2, 3, and 4, respectively. We have:\n\\[ s_2 + s_3 + s_4 = 2017 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Basic Segments\nA basic segment is a segment joining two vertices such that no other vertex lies on it.

Therefore, the total number of basic segments \\(N\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ N = 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 - 2s_2 = 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 - 2017 \\]\n\\[ N = s_3 + 2s_4 + 2017 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing and Minimizing \\(N\\)\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of \\(N\\), we need to consider the possible values of \\(s_3\\) and \\(s_4\\).\n\n#### Maximum \\(N\\)\nTo maximize \\(N\\), we should maximize \\(s_4\\) (the number of vertices of type 4) and minimize \\(s_3\\) (the number of vertices of type 3). The maximum number of vertices of type 4 is achieved when the partition is as regular as possible, i.e., when the horizontal and vertical lines are evenly spaced. In this case, the number of horizontal lines \\(h\\) and vertical lines \\(v\\) would be as close to \\(\\sqrt{2016} \\approx 45\\) as possible. For simplicity, let's assume \\(h = 45\\) and \\(v = 45\\), which gives \\(s_4 = (45-1)(45-1) = 1936\\), \\(s_3 = 45 + 45 - 1 = 89\\), and \\(s_2 = 2017 - 1936 - 89 = 92\\). Substituting these values into the equation for \\(N\\):\n\\[ N = 89 + 2 \\cdot 92 + 2017 = 89 + 184 + 2017 = 2290 \\]\n\n#### Minimum \\(N\\)\nTo minimize \\(N\\), we should minimize \\(s_4\\) and maximize \\(s_3\\). The minimum number of vertices of type 4 is 0, and the maximum number of vertices of type 3 is achieved when the partition is as irregular as possible, i.e., when the lines are not evenly spaced. In this case, the number of vertices of type 3 can be as high as \\(2017 - 2 = 2015\\) (if all but two lines are horizontal or vertical). Substituting \\(s_4 = 0\\) and \\(s_3 = 2015\\) into the equation for \\(N\\):\n\\[ N = 2015 + 2 \\cdot 0 + 2017 = 4032 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum possible number of basic segments is \\(\\boxed{4032}\\) and the minimum possible number of basic segments is \\(\\boxed{2290}\\)."

For \\( f_k \\) to be a bijection, it must be both injective and surjective. Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\) is a finite set, injectivity implies surjectivity, and vice versa. Therefore, \\( f_k \\) is a bijection if and only if \\( f_k \\) is injective.\n\n### Step 3: Injectivity Condition\nFor \\( f_k \\) to be injective, the equation \\( f_k(x_1) = f_k(x_2) \\) must imply \\( x_1 = x_2 \\). This translates to:\n\\[ g(x_1) + kx_1 \\equiv g(x_2) + kx_2 \\pmod{n} \\]\n\\[ g(x_1) - g(x_2) \\equiv k(x_2 - x_1) \\pmod{n} \\]\nSince \\( g \\) is a bijection, \\( g(x_1) \\neq g(x_2) \\) if \\( x_1 \\neq x_2 \\). Therefore, the above equation implies:\n\\[ k \\equiv \\frac{g(x_1) - g(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} \\pmod{n} \\]\nFor \\( f_k \\) to be injective for all \\( k \\) in \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\} \\), \\( k \\) must be invertible modulo \\( n \\) for all \\( k \\) in \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Invertibility Condition\nFor \\( k \\) to be invertible modulo \\( n \\), \\( \\gcd(k, n) = 1 \\). This must hold for all \\( k \\) in \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\} \\). The only number \\( n \\) that satisfies this condition for all \\( k \\) in \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\} \\) is \\( n = 1 \\). This is because if \\( n > 1 \\), there will be some \\( k \\) in \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\} \\) that shares a common factor with \\( n \\), making \\( k \\) non-invertible modulo \\( n \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integer \\( n \\) for which there exists a bijective function \\( g: \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\) such that the 101 functions \\( g(x), g(x) + x, g(x) + 2x, \\ldots, g(x) + 100x \\) are all bijections on \\( \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\) is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

Therefore, \\( a \\) must be coprime with 37.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The positive integers \\( a \\) that are coprime with 37 are all the positive integers less than 37 that are not divisible by 37. Since 37 is a prime number, the only positive integer less than 37 that is not coprime with 37 is 37 itself, but we are only considering positive integers less than 37. Therefore, all positive integers \\( a \\) from 1 to 36 are coprime with 37.\n\nThus, the positive integers \\( a \\) that satisfy the given conditions are all the integers from 1 to 36. The answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 36}\n\\]"

Since \\( m \\) must be coprime to \\( n \\), \\( m \\) must be coprime to each \\( p_i \\).

This implies that \\(p\\) must divide 2, so \\(p = 2\\).\n\n### Step 7: Verify the solution for \\(p = 2\\)\n\nIf \\(p = 2\\), then \\(n\\) must be a power of 2. Let \\(n = 2^m\\) for some integer \\(m \\geq 1\\). We need to check if \\(\\frac{(a+1)^{2^m} - a^{2^m}}{2^m}\\) is an integer for any positive integer \\(a\\).\n\n### Step 8: Check the expression for \\(n = 2\\)\n\nFor \\(n = 2\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{(a+1)^2 - a^2}{2} = \\frac{a^2 + 2a + 1 - a^2}{2} = \\frac{2a + 1}{2}\n\\]\nFor this to be an integer, \\(2a + 1\\) must be even. Since \\(2a\\) is always even, \\(2a + 1\\) is always odd, and thus not divisible by 2. Therefore, \\(n = 2\\) does not work.\n\n### Step 9: Check higher powers of 2\n\nFor \\(n = 4\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{(a+1)^4 - a^4}{4} = \\frac{a^4 + 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1 - a^4}{4} = \\frac{4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1}{4}\n\\]\nFor this to be an integer, \\(4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1\\) must be divisible by 4. Since \\(4a^3\\) and \\(4a\\) are divisible by 4, we need \\(6a^2 + 1\\) to be divisible by 4. This is not always true for all \\(a\\).\n\n### Step 10: Generalize for higher powers of 2\n\nFor higher powers of 2, the same logic applies. The expression \\((a+1)^{2^m} - a^{2^m}\\) will not be divisible by \\(2^m\\) for all \\(a\\) unless \\(a\\) is chosen such that the expression simplifies to a form divisible by \\(2^m\\). This is not generally true for all \\(a\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only case that works is when \\(n = 1\\), but since \\(n > 1\\), there are no positive integer pairs \\((a, n)\\) that satisfy the given condition.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No solutions}}\n\\]"

This problem is related to the Erd\u0151s-Szekeres theorem in combinatorial mathematics, specifically the poset version of the theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that any sequence of \\( n \\) subsets of \\( X \\) will contain a monotone 3-term chain.\n   - A monotone 3-term chain means either \\( A_i \\subseteq A_j \\subseteq A_k \\) or \\( A_i \\supseteq A_j \\supseteq A_k \\) for some \\( 1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq n \\).\n\n2. **Using the Erd\u0151s-Szekeres Theorem:**\n   - The Erd\u0151s-Szekeres theorem states that for any sequence of \\( (r-1)(s-1) + 1 \\) distinct numbers, there is either an increasing subsequence of length \\( r \\) or a decreasing subsequence of length \\( s \\).\n   - In our case, we are dealing with subsets of a set \\( X \\) with 100 elements, and we want to find a chain of length 3 (either increasing or decreasing).\n\n3. **Applying the Theorem:**\n   - For \\( r = s = 3 \\), the theorem tells us that in any sequence of \\( (3-1)(3-1) + 1 = 2 \\times 2 + 1 = 5 \\) subsets, there will be a monotone 3-term chain.\n   - However, this is not sufficient for our problem because we need to consider the size of the set \\( X \\), which is 100.\n\n4. **Generalizing for \\( |X| = 100 \\):**\n   - The problem can be generalized to finding the smallest \\( n \\) such that any sequence of \\( n \\) subsets of a set of size 100 will contain a monotone 3-term chain.\n   - This is related to the Sperner's theorem and the LYM (Lubell-Yamamoto-Meshalkin) inequality, but we can use a simpler combinatorial argument.\n\n5. **Constructing a Sequence Without a Monotone 3-term Chain:**\n   - Consider the middle layer of the Boolean lattice, which consists of all subsets of \\( X \\) with 50 elements. The number of such subsets is \\( \\binom{100}{50} \\).\n   - If we take a sequence of \\( \\binom{100}{50} \\) subsets, it is possible to avoid having a monotone 3-term chain. This is because the middle layer is the largest layer in the Boolean lattice, and any sequence of subsets from this layer can be Avoiding such a chain.\n\n6. **Finding the Minimum \\( n \\):**\n   - To ensure that any sequence of \\( n \\) subsets will contain a monotone 3-term chain, \\( n \\) must be greater than the number of subsets in the middle layer.\n   - Therefore, \\( n \\) must be at least \\( \\binom{100}{50} + 1 \\).\n\n7. **Calculating \\( \\binom{100}{50} \\):**\n   - The exact value of \\( \\binom{100}{50} \\) is a very large number, but we only need to know that it is the number of subsets of size 50 in a set of 100 elements.\n   - For our purposes, we can use the fact that \\( \\binom{100}{50} \\) is a very large number, and adding 1 ensures that any sequence of this length will contain a monotone 3-term chain.\n\nThus, the smallest possible \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{101}\n\\]"

If we start with an \\( n \\times n \\) matrix where each cell is either 0 or 1, we want to determine the maximum number of zeros we can force by performing these toggles.\n\nA key insight is that we can use the toggling operations to achieve a matrix with the maximum number of zeros.

This will ensure that after performing these operations, each row will have an even number of 1's, and the matrix will have the maximum number of zeros.\n\n2. **Counting Zeros**: After performing the toggles, the number of zeros in the matrix will be maximized.

Let the sum of the entries in the \\( i \\)-th block be \\( S_i \\). Initially, all \\( S_i = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Strategy Analysis\n\\( A \\) aims to ensure that at least one of the sums \\( S_i \\) exceeds \\( k \\) at some finite point. \\( B \\) will always choose the block with the maximum sum and set all its entries to zero.\n\n### Step 3: Mirroring Strategy\n\\( A \\) can use a mirroring strategy to ensure that at least one block sum exceeds \\( k \\). The key idea is to ensure that the sum of the entries in any block can be increased sufficiently before \\( B \\) can clear it.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the threshold \\( k \\)\nTo find the threshold \\( k \\), we need to consider the worst-case scenario where \\( B \\) always clears the block with the highest sum.

However, \\( B \\) will clear the block with the maximum sum, so the maximum sum \\( M_n \\) cannot be maintained indefinitely. Instead, \\( A \\) needs to ensure that at least one block's sum exceeds \\( k \\) before \\( B \\) can clear it.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Minimum \\( k \\)\nTo ensure that \\( A \\) can always win, \\( k \\) must be such that \\( A \\) can force a block sum to exceed \\( k \\) before \\( B \\) can clear it.

One way to do this is to consider the set \\( S \\) to be composed of elements that are products of distinct primes. This ensures that for any two elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\( S \\), there will always be an element \\( c \\) that is coprime to both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (since \\( c \\) can be a product of primes not present in \\( a \\) or \\( b \\)).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Maximum Size of \\( S \\)\nThe set \\( S \\) can be constructed by choosing elements that are products of distinct primes. The number of distinct primes less than or equal to 108 is 26 (since the 26th prime is 101 and the 27th prime is 103, which is greater than 108). Therefore, the largest possible size of \\( S \\) is the number of non-empty subsets of these 26 primes, which is \\( 2^{26} - 1 \\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if this set satisfies the second condition. For any two elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\( S \\), we can always find a prime \\( p \\) that divides neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) (since there are 26 primes and each element of \\( S \\) is a product of some of these primes). The product of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with \\( p \\) will be an element of \\( S \\) that shares a nontrivial common divisor with both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nThus, the set \\( S \\) consisting of all products of distinct primes (up to 108) satisfies both conditions. The number of such products is \\( 2^{26} - 1 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest possible value of \\( |S| \\) is \\(\\boxed{2^{26} - 1}\\)."

Therefore, the proper divisors of \\( n = 2^k \\cdot p \\) that are in \\( S \\) are \\( 1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2^k \\) and \\( p, 2p, 4p, \\ldots, 2^{k-1}p \\) if they are odd primes.\n\nFor \\( n = 2^k \\cdot p \\) to satisfy the condition, we need:\n\\[ \\sum_{d|n, d<n, d \\in S} d = 1 + 2 + 4 + \\cdots + 2^k + p + 2p + 4p + \\cdots + 2^{k-1}p = n. \\]\n\nThe sum of the powers of 2 is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + \\cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1. \\]\n\nThe sum of the multiples of \\( p \\) is:\n\\[ p(1 + 2 + 4 + \\cdots + 2^{k-1}) = p(2^k - 1). \\]\n\nTherefore, the total sum is:\n\\[ 2^{k+1} - 1 + p(2^k - 1) = 2^{k+1} - 1 + p \\cdot 2^k - p = (2^{k+1} + p \\cdot 2^k) - (1 + p) = 2^k(2 + p) - (1 + p). \\]\n\nWe need this to be equal to \\( n = 2^k \\cdot p \\):\n\\[ 2^k(2 + p) - (1 + p) = 2^k \\cdot p. \\]\n\\[ 2^k(2 + p) - 2^k \\cdot p = 1 + p. \\]\n\\[ 2^k \\cdot 2 = 1 + p. \\]\n\\[ 2^{k+1} = 1 + p. \\]\n\nSince \\( p \\) is an odd prime, \\( 2^{k+1} \\) must be an odd number plus 1, which means \\( 2^{k+1} \\) must be an even number. The only even power of 2 is 2, but \\( 2^{k+1} = 2 \\) implies \\( k+1 = 1 \\), so \\( k = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( p = 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^1 - 1 = 1 \\), but 1 is not a prime. The next possible value is \\( 2^{k+1} = 4 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( p = 4 - 1 = 3 \\). Therefore, \\( n = 2^1 \\cdot 3 = 6 \\).\n\nWe need to verify that \\( n = 6 \\) satisfies the condition:\nThe proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. Since 1, 2, and 3 are all in \\( S \\), we have:\n\\[ \\sum_{d|6, d<6, d \\in S} d = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. \\]\nThus, \\( n = 6 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the only positive integer \\( n = 2^k \\cdot p \\) such that \\( \\sum_{d|n, d<n, d \\in S} d = n \\) is \\( \\boxed{6} \\)."
