      "response": "To determine the number of good arrangements of the numbers in the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p^2\\}\\) arranged in a \\(p \\times p\\) matrix \\(A = (a_{ij})\\), we need to understand the conditions under which we can transform the matrix into the zero matrix using the allowed operations.\n\n### Step 1: Additive Separation\nWe start by noting that the condition \\(a_{ij} = u_i + v_j\\) for some integers \\(u_i\\) and \\(v_j\\) is necessary and sufficient for the matrix to be transformable into the zero matrix. This means that each element \\(a_{ij}\\) in the matrix can be expressed as the sum of a row-specific constant \\(u_i\\) and a column-specific constant \\(v_j\\).\n\n### Step 2: Modulo \\(p\\) Argument\nSince \\(a_{ij}\\) takes values in \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p^2\\}\\), we can consider the residues of \\(a_{ij}\\) modulo \\(p\\). Let \\(A \\mod p\\) be the matrix where each element \\(a_{ij}\\) is replaced by its residue modulo \\(p\\). The condition \\(a_{ij} = u_i + v_j\\) implies that the residues of \\(a_{ij}\\) modulo \\(p\\) must also satisfy the same form, i.e., \\(a_{ij} \\mod p = u_i + v_j \\mod p\\).\n\n### Step 3: Row and Column Permutations\nTo simplify the problem, we can consider the matrix \\(A \\mod p\\) and the possible values of \\(u_i\\) and \\(v_j\\) modulo \\(p\\). Since \\(u_i\\) and \\(v_j\\) are integers, they can take any value in \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting Good Arrangements\nWe need to count the number of matrices \\(A\\) such that the residues of \\(a_{ij}\\) modulo \\(p\\) can be expressed as \\(u_i + v_j \\mod p\\). This means that the residues of the elements in each row and each column must be the same modulo \\(p\\).\n\n#### Case 1: Row-wise blocks\nIf the residues of the elements in each row are the same, then the matrix can be divided into \\(p\\) blocks, each of size \\(p \\times 1\\). The number of ways to choose a permutation of these \\(p\\) blocks among the \\(p\\) rows is \\(p!\\). For each block, the elements can be any permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p\\}\\), and there are \\(p!\\) ways to permute the elements within each block. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the elements in this case is:\n\\[\n(p!)^2\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Column-wise blocks\nSimilarly, if the residues of the elements in each column are the same, then the matrix can be divided into \\(p\\) blocks, each of size \\(1 \\times p\\). The number of ways to choose a permutation of these \\(p\\) blocks among the \\(p\\) columns is \\(p!\\). For each block, the elements can be any permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p\\}\\), and there are \\(p!\\) ways to permute the elements within each block. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the elements in this case is:\n\\[\n(p!)^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Total Number of Good Arrangements\nSince the two cases (row-wise and column-wise blocks) are disjoint, we add the number of arrangements from each case to get the total number of good arrangements:\n\\[\n(p!)^2 + (p!)^2 = 2(p!)^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of good arrangements is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2(p!)^2}\n\\]"

Each \\( a_i \\) is divisible by 6, so we can write \\( a_i = 6b_i \\) for some positive integer \\( b_i \\).\n\n### Step 2: Graph Representation\nWe represent the situation with a graph \\( H \\) where vertices are players and edges are pairs. Since each player belongs to at most two pairs, \\( H \\) consists of paths and cycles. Let \\( M \\) be the graph where vertices are pairs and edges represent matches between pairs. \\( M \\) is simple and by condition (ii), it is a simple graph.\n\n### Step 3: Maximum Game Player\nConsider the player \\( r \\) who plays the maximum number of games, \\( a = \\max A \\). Assume \\( r \\) is in pairs \\( \\{r, u\\} \\) and \\( \\{r, v\\} \\). The player \\( r \\) can play at most \\( 2|P| \\) games, where \\( P \\) is the set of players other than \\( r, u, v \\). Therefore, \\( a \\leq 2|P| \\), which implies \\( |P| \\geq \\frac{a}{2} \\).\n\nThe total number of players is \\( |P| + 3 \\), so we have:\n\\[\nn \\geq \\frac{a}{2} + 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Graph \\( G \\)\nWe need to construct a graph \\( G \\) whose degree set is exactly \\( S = \\left\\{ \\frac{a_i}{6} \\right\\} \\) with \\( s = \\max S \\). We will use induction to construct \\( G \\).\n\n#### Base Case: \\( s = 1 \\)\nFor \\( s = 1 \\), \\( S = \\{1\\} \\), we use \\( K_2 \\) (a complete graph on 2 vertices) with degree set \\( \\{1\\} \\).\n\n#### Inductive Step: \\( s > 1 \\)\nAssume we have a graph \\( H' \\) on \\( s \\) vertices with degree set \\( S' = \\{t - 1 : t \\in S, t < s\\} \\). Add a new vertex \\( z \\) adjacent to all \\( s \\) old vertices, so \\( \\deg_G(z) = s \\) and each old degree increases by 1, making the degree set exactly \\( S \\).\n\nNow, replace each vertex \\( v \\) of \\( G \\) by a 3-player triangle gadget \\( T_v \\). Each player in \\( T_v \\) is in exactly two fixed pairs, and each pair-pair across gadgets meets at most once. The number of games for each player in \\( T_v \\) is \\( 6 \\cdot \\deg_G(v) \\), which matches the elements of \\( A \\).\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Total Number of Players\nThe number of gadgets is \\( n = s + 1 \\), and each gadget has 3 players.

After \\( n \\) steps, we get:\n\\[ f(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Difference Between Two Shifted Points\nWe apply the same binomial averaging identity at the shifted point \\((x-1, y+1)\\):\n\\[ f(x-1, y+1) = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f((x-1)-k, (y+1)-(n-k)) \\]\n\\[ f(x-1, y+1) = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-1-k, y+1-n+k) \\]\n\nBy subtracting the two expansions, we get:\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) - \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-1-k, y+1-n+k) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Difference\nWe can reindex the second sum by letting \\( j = k \\):\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) - \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-1-k, y+1-n+k) \\]\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) - \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-1-(k-1), y+1-n+k-1) \\]\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) - \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k-1} f(x-1-k+1, y+1-n+k-1) \\]\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) - \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k-1} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) \\]\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\left( \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1} \\right) f(x-k, y-(n-k)) \\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Binomial Coefficient Identity\nWe use the identity \\( \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} \\) for \\( k \\geq 1 \\) and \\( \\binom{n}{0} - \\binom{n}{-1} = 1 \\):\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} f(x-k, y-(n-k)) \\]\n\n### Step 6: Summation by Parts\nWe sum this expression over \\( n \\):\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} F_k \\]\nwhere \\( F_k = f(x-k, y-(n-k)) \\). The sum of the binomial coefficients is:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \\sum_{m=-1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{m} = 2^{n-1} \\]\nThus,\n\\[ 2^n (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = 2^{n-1} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} F_k \\]\n\\[ 2 (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} F_k \\]\n\n### Step 7: Bounding the Difference\nWe know that \\( F_k \\in [0, 1] \\), so:\n\\[ |2 (f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1))| \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} = 2^{n-1} \\]\n\\[ |f(x, y) - f(x-1, y+1)| \\leq 2^{n-2} \\]\n\nAs \\( n \\to \\infty \\), \\( 2^{n-2} \\to 0 \\), so:\n\\[ f(x, y) = f(x-1, y+1) \\]\n\n### Step 8: Propagation of Equality\nSince \\( f(x, y) = f(x-1, y+1) \\), we can propagate this equality along any anti-diagonal \\( x + y = \\text{const} \\). If \\( x + y = s \\), then \\( f(x, y) = f(x-1, y+1) = f(x-2, y+2) = \\cdots = f(x-s, y+s) \\). Since \\( f(x, y) \\) is constant along each anti-diagonal, and the original equation implies that the value on diagonal \\( s \\) equals the average of its two predecessors on diagonal \\( s-1 \\), it follows that \\( f(x, y) \\) is constant along each diagonal \\( s \\).\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nSince \\( f(x, y) \\) is constant along each diagonal, and the value on diagonal \\( s \\) is the same for all \\( s \\), \\( f(x, y) \\) is constant for all \\( (x, y) \\). Let \\( c \\) be this constant value. Then:\n\\[ f(x, y) = c \\]\nfor all \\( (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\).\n\nThus, the only solution is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(x, y) = c} \\]\nwhere \\( c \\) is a constant in the interval \\([0, 1]\\)."

The only new prime factor here is 2, which also divides \\(a - 1 = 2^k - 1 - 1 = 2^k - 2 = 2(2^{k-1} - 1)\\). Therefore, the condition is satisfied for \\(n = 2\\) and \\(a = 2^k - 1\\).\n\nFinally, let's check the exception \\(n = 6\\) and \\(a = 2\\):\n- For \\(a = 2\\) and \\(n = 6\\), we have \\(a^6 - 1 = 2^6 - 1 = 63 = 3^2 \\cdot 7\\). The prime factors 3 and 7 are not primitive because \\(3 \\mid 2^2 - 1\\) and \\(7 \\mid 2^3 - 1\\). Therefore, the condition is not satisfied for \\(n = 6\\) and \\(a = 2\\).\n\nCombining all the cases, the solutions are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(1, n) \\text{ for any } n \\ge 1 \\text{ and } (2, 1)}\n\\]"

This implies that the polynomial \\( (t - x_1)(t - x_2) \\cdots (t - x_n) \\) must be the same for all \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Polynomial's Coefficients\nThe polynomial \\( (t - x_1)(t - x_2) \\cdots (t - x_n) \\) has coefficients that are symmetric functions of the roots \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\). For \\( Q_k(t) \\) to be independent of \\( k \\), the coefficients of \\( t^{n-1} \\) and lower must be zero. This implies that the sum of the roots \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) must be zero modulo \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 6: Use Wilson's Theorem\nWilson's theorem states that for a prime \\( p \\), \\( (p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\). If \\( n \\) has a prime factor \\( p \\leq 101 \\), then \\( n \\) must be such that the sum of the roots modulo \\( p \\) is zero. This implies that \\( n \\) must be a multiple of \\( p \\).\n\n### Step 7: Determine the Valid \\( n \\)\nSince \\( n \\) must be a multiple of all primes \\( p \\leq 101 \\), the smallest such \\( n \\) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the primes \\( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101 \\).\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the LCM\nThe LCM of these primes is:\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 19 \\times 23 \\times 29 \\times 31 \\times 37 \\times 41 \\times 43 \\times 47 \\times 53 \\times 59 \\times 61 \\times 67 \\times 71 \\times 73 \\times 79 \\times 83 \\times 89 \\times 97 \\times 101. \\]\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nThe only positive integer \\( n \\) for which there exists a bijective function \\( g: \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\) such that the 101 functions \\( g(x), g(x) + x, g(x) + 2x, \\ldots, g(x) + 100x \\) are all bijections is \\( n = \\text{LCM}(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101) \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{LCM}(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101)}\n\\]"

      "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find a function \\( f: \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\) such that for any \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\), the condition \\( f(f(x) + y) \\mid x + f(y) \\) holds. We will consider both the injective and bounded cases.\n\n### Case 1: Injective Function\nFirst, let's assume \\( f \\) is injective. This means that if \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), then \\( a = b \\).\n\n1. Set \\( f(1) = t \\). Then, for \\( y = 1 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   f(t + 1) \\mid 1 + f(1) \\implies f(t + 1) \\mid 1 + t.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( f(t + 1) \\) is a positive integer, \\( f(t + 1) \\) must be a divisor of \\( 1 + t \\).\n\n2. Next, consider \\( x = t + 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(f(t + 1) + 1) \\mid (t + 1) + f(1) \\implies f(f(t + 1) + 1) \\mid (t + 1) + t = 2t + 1.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( f \\) is injective, \\( f(t + 1) \\) must be the smallest positive integer that divides \\( 1 + t \\). Therefore, \\( f(t + 1) = 1 + t \\).\n\n3. Now, we need to check if \\( f(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\). Assume \\( f(k) = k \\) for all \\( k < n \\). We need to show \\( f(n) = n \\). Set \\( x = n \\) and \\( y = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(f(n) + 1) \\mid n + f(1) \\implies f(f(n) + 1) \\mid n + t.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( f \\) is injective and \\( f(k) = k \\) for all \\( k < n \\), \\( f(n) \\) must be the smallest integer greater than \\( t \\) that divides \\( n + t \\).

Therefore, \\( f(n) = n \\).\n\nBy induction, we have \\( f(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\).\n\n### Case 2: Bounded Function\nNow, let's assume \\( f \\) is bounded. This means there exists a positive integer \\( M \\) such that \\( f(n) \\leq M \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\n1. Let \\( S \\) be the set of image values of \\( f \\) that have infinite preimage. Since \\( f \\) is bounded, \\( S \\) is a finite set. Fix \\( t \\in S \\) and distinct \\( a, b \\) such that \\( f(a) = f(b) = t \\). For any \\( y \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   f(t + y) \\mid (a + f(y)) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(t + y) \\mid (b + f(y)).\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( f(t + y) \\mid (a - b) \\).

If \\( S \\) contains any number \\( \\geq 3 \\), we can derive incompatible divisibility requirements by combining different shifts. Therefore, \\( S \\) must be \\( \\{1, 2\\} \\).\n\n3. When \\( S = \\{1\\} \\), \\( f \\) takes the value 1 infinitely often. Let \\( f(n) = 1 \\) for all \\( n > 1 \\) and \\( f(1) \\) be unconstrained. We need to check if this satisfies the divisibility condition. For \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = y \\):\n   \\[\n   f(1 + y) \\mid 1 + f(y) \\implies 1 \\mid 1 + f(y).\n   \\]\n   This is always true. Therefore, \\( f(n) = 1 \\) for all \\( n > 1 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n4. When \\( S = \\{1, 2\\} \\), \\( f \\) takes the values 1 and 2. We need to check the parity pattern. Assume \\( f(1) = 1 \\) and \\( f(2) = 2 \\). For \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(3) \\mid 2 + f(1) \\implies f(3) \\mid 3.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( f(3) \\) must be 1 or 2, and \\( f(3) \\neq 2 \\) (otherwise \\( f(2) = 2 \\) and \\( f(3) = 2 \\) would contradict the injectivity), we have \\( f(3) = 1 \\). By similar reasoning, we can show that \\( f(n) \\) alternates between 1 and 2. This pattern satisfies the divisibility condition.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are \\( f(n) = n \\) and \\( f(n) = 1 \\) for \\( n > 1 \\) with \\( f(1) \\) unconstrained. The final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(n) = n \\text{ or } f(n) = 1 \\text{ for } n > 1 \\text{ with } f(1) \\text{ unconstrained}}\n\\]"

This makes:\n  \\[ P(x, y, z) = N + S \\cdot 0^2 = N. \\]\n  Since \\( N = n \\), we have \\( P(x, y, z) = n \\).\n\n- If \\( n \\) is a square, then \\( \\forall u \\, F(n, u) \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, \\( U(T_0; n, x, y, z) \\neq 0 \\) for all \\( (x, y, z) \\). This makes:\n  \\[ P(x, y, z) = N + S \\cdot U(T_0; n, x, y, z)^2. \\]\n  Since \\( S > 0 \\) and \\( U(T_0; n, x, y, z) \\neq 0 \\), \\( P(x, y, z) \\neq n \\).\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring the Polynomial Uses Only Three Variables\nThe polynomial \\( P(x, y, z) \\) is constructed using \\( x, y, z \\) and the fixed constants \\( N \\) and \\( S \\). Since \\( N \\) and \\( S \\) are absorbed into the coefficients of the polynomial, \\( P(x, y, z) \\) uses only three variables.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying Integer Coefficients\nThe polynomials \\( F(n, u) \\), \\( U \\), and \\( T_0 \\) have integer coefficients. The polynomial \\( S = 1 + (x + y + z)^2 \\) also has integer coefficients. Therefore, \\( P(x, y, z) \\) has integer coefficients.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe polynomial \\( P(x, y, z) = x + (1 + (x + y + z)^2) \\cdot U(T_0; x, y, z)^2 \\) satisfies the given condition. Thus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P(x, y, z) = x + (1 + (x + y + z)^2) \\cdot U(T_0; x, y, z)^2}\n\\]"

      "response": "To determine whether there exist positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a \\) does not divide \\( b^n - n \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\), we will analyze the sequence \\( (n_k) \\) defined by \\( n_1 = b \\) and \\( n_{k+1} = b^{n_k} \\) modulo \\( a \\).\n\n### Step 1: Sequence Analysis\nWe need to show that the sequence \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( a \\). If \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( a \\), then for some large \\( k \\), we have \\( n_{k+1} \\equiv n_k \\pmod{a} \\). This implies that \\( b^{n_k} \\equiv n_k \\pmod{a} \\), which is the fixed point condition we are looking for.\n\n### Step 2: Base Cases\nFirst, we handle the base cases \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\):\n- For \\( a = 1 \\), any integer is congruent to 0 modulo 1, so \\( n_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1} \\) for all \\( k \\). This is trivially true.\n- For \\( a = 2 \\), we need to check the parity of \\( b \\):\n  - If \\( b \\) is even, then \\( b^x \\) is even for all \\( x \\), and \\( n_k \\) will be even for all \\( k \\). Since \\( n_k \\) is even, \\( n_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\) for all \\( k \\).\n  - If \\( b \\) is odd, then \\( b^x \\) is odd for all \\( x \\), and \\( n_k \\) will be odd for all \\( k \\). Since \\( n_k \\) is odd, \\( n_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\) for all \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 3: Induction Hypothesis\nAssume that for all \\( a < a_0 \\), the sequence \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( a \\). We need to show that this holds for \\( a_0 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Prime Powers\nConsider \\( a_0 = p^k \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime. We need to show that the sequence \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( p^k \\). By Euler's theorem, if \\( \\gcd(b, p) = 1 \\), then \\( b^{\\phi(p^k)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^k} \\), where \\( \\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} \\). Therefore, \\( n_{k+1} \\equiv b^{n_k \\mod \\phi(p^k)} \\pmod{p^k} \\).\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, since \\( \\phi(p^k) < p^k \\), the sequence \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( \\phi(p^k) \\). Let \\( n_k \\equiv c \\pmod{\\phi(p^k)} \\) for some constant \\( c \\). Then \\( n_{k+1} \\equiv b^c \\pmod{p^k} \\). Since \\( b^c \\) is a fixed value modulo \\( p^k \\), the sequence \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( p^k \\).\n\n### Step 5: Combining Results\nIf \\( a_0 \\) has prime factors \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m \\), then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the sequence \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( a_0 \\) if it is eventually constant modulo \\( p_i^{k_i} \\) for all \\( i \\). Since we have shown that the sequence is eventually constant modulo \\( p_i^{k_i} \\), it follows that \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( a_0 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince \\( (n_k) \\) is eventually constant modulo \\( a \\), there exists some \\( k \\) such that \\( n_{k+1} \\equiv n_k \\pmod{a} \\). This implies \\( b^{n_k} \\equiv n_k \\pmod{a} \\), so \\( a \\) divides \\( b^{n_k} - n_k \\). Therefore, there do not exist positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a \\) does not divide \\( b^n - n \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}\n\\]"

The first condition gives us:\n\\[ n \\mid a_n^2 + a_{2n}^2, \\]\n\\[ n \\mid a_n^2 + a_{3n}^2, \\]\n\\[ n \\mid a_{2n}^2 + a_{3n}^2. \\]\n\nAdding the first two and subtracting the third, we get:\n\\[ n \\mid 2a_n^2. \\]\nThis implies that \\( n \\mid 2a_n^2 \\) for all \\( n \\).

For any distinct positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), we have:\n\\[ \\gcd(a_m, a_n) \\mid m^2 + n^2. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the possible values of \\( a_n \\)\nFrom the first condition, we know that \\( a_n \\) must be such that \\( n \\mid 2a_n^2 \\). This implies that \\( a_n \\) must be a multiple of \\( n \\) or \\( n/2 \\) (if \\( n \\) is even). However, since \\( a_n \\) must be a positive integer, \\( a_n \\) must be a multiple of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of \\( k \\)-good integers\nWe need to find a \\( k \\) such that there are exactly 2019 \\( k \\)-good positive integers. Since \\( a_n \\) must be a multiple of \\( n \\), we can write \\( a_n = n b_n \\) where \\( b_n \\) is a positive integer. The second condition then becomes:\n\\[ \\gcd(n b_n, m b_m) \\mid m^2 + n^2. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ n m \\gcd(b_n, b_m) \\mid m^2 + n^2. \\]\nSince \\( \\gcd(b_n, b_m) \\) is a positive integer, it must be such that \\( n m \\gcd(b_n, b_m) \\) divides \\( m^2 + n^2 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the number of \\( k \\)-good integers\nThe number of \\( k \\)-good integers is determined by the number of possible values of \\( b_n \\) that satisfy the conditions. Since \\( b_n \\) must be such that \\( n \\gcd(b_n, b_m) \\) divides \\( m^2 + n^2 \\), the number of possible values of \\( b_n \\) is limited by the number of divisors of \\( k \\).\n\nTo have exactly 2019 \\( k \\)-good integers, \\( k \\) must have exactly 2019 divisors.

We need to find the greatest \\(\\lambda\\) such that we can pick 150 entries from the matrix such that the sum of entries in each row and each column is at least \\(\\lambda\\) when the other entries are replaced by 0.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing the Argument\nWe will use the idea of finding a 50-matching in the bipartite graph \\(G_{\\ge t}\\) with \\(t \\le \\frac{1}{100}\\). If we can find such a matching, we can use these 50 entries to cover 50 rows and 50 columns. Then, we can pick one maximal entry in each of the remaining 50 rows and one maximal entry in each of the remaining 50 columns, ensuring that the total number of picks is at most 150.\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring a 50-Matching\nTo ensure a 50-matching in \\(G_{\\ge t}\\), we use Hall's Marriage Theorem. We need to show that for any set \\(S\\) of vertices, the number of neighbors \\(N(S)\\) of \\(S\\) satisfies \\(|S| \\le |N(S)|\\). Using the inequality \\(|S| < |N(S)| + (100 - |N(S)|) |S| t\\), we can derive that \\(|N(S)| \\ge |S| - 50\\). This ensures that a 50-matching exists.\n\n### Step 4: Completing the Selection Scheme\nAfter finding the 50-matching, we need to ensure that the sum of entries in each row and each column is at least \\(\\lambda\\). We can do this by picking one maximal entry in each of the remaining 50 rows and one maximal entry in each of the remaining 50 columns. Since each row and each column in a doubly stochastic matrix has a sum of 1, each of these entries is at least \\(t\\). Given \\(t \\le \\frac{1}{100}\\), the sum of entries in each row and each column will be at least \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Showing No Larger Threshold Works\nTo show that no larger threshold works, we construct a 4-block doubly stochastic matrix with a \\(25 \\times 24\\) zero top-left block, a \\(75 \\times 24\\) block of equal positives, a \\(25 \\times 76\\) block of equal positives, and a \\(75 \\times 76\\) block of a uniform smaller value chosen to make all row/column sums equal 1. For any \\(t\\) above the chosen threshold, we need to select at least 76 entries from the top-right block to lift each of the last 76 columns and at least 75 entries from the bottom-left block to lift each of the last 75 rows, totaling 151 > 150. This shows that no larger threshold works.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe greatest constant \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{100}}\\)."

The point \\( P \\) will be in one of these exterior half-spaces for each edge it is considering.\n\nTo maximize the number of visible edges, we need to position \\( P \\) such that it is in the exterior half-spaces for the maximum number of edges. By symmetry, we can assume \\( x_0, y_0, z_0 \\geq 0 \\). The conditions for the visibility of the edges can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The edges through \\( A2 \\) (i.e., \\( (0,0,-1) \\)) are not visible if \\( x_0 + y_0 \\leq 1 + z_0 \\).\n2. The edges through \\( B2 \\) (i.e., \\( (0,-1,0) \\)) are not visible if \\( y_0 + z_0 \\leq 1 + x_0 \\).\n3. The edges through \\( C2 \\) (i.e., \\( (0,1,0) \\)) are not visible if \\( z_0 + x_0 \\leq 1 + y_0 \\).\n\nTo maximize the number of visible edges, we need to satisfy the strict inequalities:\n\\[ x_0 + y_0 > 1 + z_0, \\]\n\\[ y_0 + z_0 > 1 + x_0, \\]\n\\[ z_0 + x_0 > 1 + y_0. \\]\n\nUnder these conditions, every edge incident to at least one of \\( A1 \\), \\( B1 \\), or \\( C1 \\) will be visible, and every edge of the opposite face \\( A2B2C2 \\) will be not visible. The octahedron has 12 edges, and the edges along the face opposite \\( P \\) (i.e., \\( A2B2C2 \\)) are 3. Therefore, the number of visible edges is:\n\\[ 12 - 3 = 9. \\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of edges of the regular octahedron that can be seen from a point outside the octahedron is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."

This means that the period can increase by at most a factor of \\( p \\) when moving from \\( p^{t-1} \\) to \\( p^t \\).\n\n### Step 5: Induction\nWe use induction to show that the cycle length modulo \\( p^t \\) is \\( p \\)-smooth. Let \\( a \\) lie on a cycle of length \\( n \\) modulo \\( p^t \\) and let \\( m \\) be its cycle length modulo \\( p^{t-1} \\). Set \\( T = P^m \\), so \\( T \\) fixes \\( a \\) modulo \\( p^{t-1} \\). Among the \\( p \\) lifts above \\( a \\) modulo \\( p^t \\), the action of \\( T \\) has period dividing \\( p \\). Therefore, \\( n/m \\) divides \\( p \\), and by induction, \\( m \\) is \\( p \\)-smooth, so \\( n \\) is \\( p \\)-smooth.\n\n### Step 6: Necessity\nAssume \\( n \\) has a prime divisor \\( p \\). Then \\( m \\) must have a prime divisor \\( q \\le p \\). Since \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\), \\( q \\) must divide \\( n \\), which is a contradiction. Therefore, \\( n \\) cannot have any prime divisors, meaning \\( n \\) must be 2.\n\n### Step 7: Sufficiency\nAssume \\( n = 2 \\). We can choose \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( P(x) = x + 1 \\). Then:\n- \\( P(0) = 1 \\) (not divisible by 2).\n- \\( P^2(0) = P(1) = 2 \\) (divisible by 2).\n\nThus, \\( n = 2 \\) satisfies all the conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only integer \\( n \\ge 2 \\) that satisfies the given conditions is \\( n = 2 \\). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

This is not consistent with \\(2^a p^b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}\\). Therefore, \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\) and \\(c\\) is odd.\n\n4. **Consider the case \\(p+2 = 2^a\\):**\n   Since \\(p\\) is odd, \\(p+2\\) is odd, so \\(a = 1\\).

This means \\(p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\\). We can write the equation as:\n   \\[\n   2^a p^b = (2^a - 3)^c + 1\n   \\]\n   Reducing modulo \\(p\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   2^a p^b \\equiv (-3)^c + 1 \\pmod{p}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\\), \\(2^a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p}\\) (because \\(a = 3\\)). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   2 p^b \\equiv (-3)^c + 1 \\pmod{p}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\\), \\((-3)^c \\equiv (-1)^c 3^c \\equiv -3^c \\pmod{p}\\).

Therefore:\n   \\[\n   -6 \\equiv -3^c + 1 \\pmod{8} \\implies -7 \\equiv -3^c \\pmod{8} \\implies 1 \\equiv 3^c \\pmod{8}\n   \\]\n   The powers of 3 modulo 8 are \\(3, 1, 3, 1, \\ldots\\), so \\(c\\) must be even, but we know \\(c\\) is odd. This is a contradiction, so \\(p \\neq 5 \\pmod{8}\\).\n\n6. **Case \\(p = 3\\):**\n   If \\(p = 3\\), then the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^a 3^b = 5^c + 1\n   \\]\n   If \\(a \\geq 2\\), then reducing modulo 4 gives:\n   \\[\n   0 \\equiv 5^c + 1 \\pmod{4} \\implies 5^c \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4} \\implies 1^c \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4} \\implies 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}\n   \\]\n   which is a contradiction.

      "response": "To determine the largest \\( N(n) \\) such that for any initial choice of integers, I can make a finite number of moves so that there are at least \\( N(n) \\) even numbers on the board, we need to analyze the problem in both even and odd cases of \\( n \\).\n\n### Case 1: \\( n \\) is even\nFor even \\( n \\), we can use a strategy to toggle exactly \\( n \\) prescribed cells by simultaneous crosses. Specifically, we can use the permutation-set toggles \\( S_k = \\{(1,1), (k,1), (1,k)\\} \\cup \\{(t,t) : t \\in \\{2, \\ldots, n\\}, t \\neq k\\} \\) for \\( k = 2, \\ldots, n \\). This toggles all cells in row 1 and column 1 except for the cell at \\((n,1)\\) and \\((1,n)\\). By applying the cross at \\((n,1)\\), we can flip only \\((1,1)\\) while fixing every other cell. This allows us to implement a single-cell switch, which gives us full parity control to adjust entries locally without disturbing those already fixed. Therefore, we can achieve any desired parity configuration, and in particular, we can make at least \\( \\frac{n^2}{2} \\) cells even. This is because we can toggle any cell an even number of times to make it even, and there are \\( n^2 \\) cells in total. Since \\( n \\) is even, we can always achieve at least \\( \\frac{n^2}{2} \\) even cells.\n\n### Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd\nFor odd \\( n \\), each cross flips all row and column parities \\( r_i, c_j \\) (mod 2) because unaffected rows/columns get exactly one toggle and the targeted row/column each get \\( n \\) toggles with \\( n \\) odd. We can start with a parity matrix where the first row is \\((0, 1, 1, \\ldots, 1)\\) and the other rows are \\(0\\). This means the parity vector alternates between \\((0, \\ldots, 0; 0, 1, \\ldots, 1)\\) and \\((1, \\ldots, 1; 1, 0, \\ldots, 0)\\). In either state, at least \\( n-1 \\) columns have odd sum, so at least \\( n-1 \\) ones persist. Therefore, the number of even cells is at most \\( n^2 - (n-1) = n^2 - n + 1 \\). To attain this bound, we can fix the even \\((n-1) \\times (n-1)\\) subboard via single-cell switches and apply a majority flip on the \\( 2n-1 \\) cells in the union of the first row and first column using a cross at \\((1,1)\\). This gives us at least \\( n^2 - n + 1 \\) even cells.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining these results, we have:\n- For even \\( n \\), the largest \\( N(n) \\) is \\( \\frac{n^2}{2} \\).\n- For odd \\( n \\), the largest \\( N(n) \\) is \\( n^2 - \\frac{n-1}{2} \\).\n\nSince the problem asks for the largest \\( N(n) \\) for any \\( n \\), we need to consider both cases.

There are 8 classes, so the number of edges between the centers is:\n\\[ \\binom{8}{2} = 28 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Adding Edges Between Leaves in Different Classes\nWe also add all edges between the leaves in different classes. The number of leaves is:\n\\[ 100 - (12 \\times 7 + 4) = 100 - 84 = 16 \\]\nThe number of edges between the leaves is:\n\\[ \\binom{16}{2} - 28 = \\frac{16 \\times 15}{2} - 28 = 120 - 28 = 92 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Condition\nWe need to verify that the condition \\( N(u) \\cap N(v) = \\emptyset \\) holds for each vertex \\( u \\). Each vertex in a class is connected to its class center and no other vertex in the same class. Therefore, for any two vertices \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in the same class, \\( N(u) \\cap N(v) = \\{ \\text{class center} \\} \\neq \\emptyset \\). For vertices in different classes, the condition is satisfied because the class centers are connected to all vertices in their respective classes and the leaves are only connected to their own class center and leaves in other classes.\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Total Number of Edges\nThe total number of edges is the sum of the edges in the star graphs, the edges between the centers, and the edges between the leaves:\n\\[ 91 + 28 + 92 = 211 \\]\n\nThus, the maximal possible number of edges in \\( G \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{211} \\]"

We can use the fact that the sum of the coordinates of the points in \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) must be less than 1 and greater than 2, respectively, to derive a relationship between the sizes of these sets and the number of points \\( n \\).\n\nWe use the following inequality involving the sizes of the projections:\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 2018^{2/3} \\leq |S|^{2/3} + |T|^{2/3} \\leq n^2. \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 2018^{2/3} \\):\n\\[ 2018^{2/3} = (2018^{1/3})^2. \\]\nSince \\( 2018 \\approx 2016 = 12^3 \\), we have:\n\\[ 2018^{1/3} \\approx 12.64, \\]\nand thus:\n\\[ 2018^{2/3} \\approx 12.64^2 \\approx 159.76. \\]\nTherefore:\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 2018^{2/3} \\approx 2 \\cdot 159.76 \\approx 319.52. \\]\n\nNext, we take the cube root of both sides of the inequality:\n\\[ 319.52 \\leq n^2. \\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\\[ \\sqrt{319.52} \\leq n. \\]\nSince \\( \\sqrt{319.52} \\approx 17.87 \\), we round up to the nearest integer:\n\\[ n \\geq 18. \\]\n\nTo ensure that \\( n = 18 \\) is sufficient, we check if it satisfies the original conditions. If \\( n = 18 \\), then:\n\\[ n^2 = 18^2 = 324. \\]\nSince \\( 319.52 \\leq 324 \\), the inequality \\( 2 \\cdot 2018^{2/3} \\leq n^2 \\) is satisfied. Therefore, the minimal possible value of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{18}. \\]"

      "response": "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions and the geometric properties of the triangle.

Since \\( \\frac{DE}{20} = \\frac{EF}{22} = \\frac{FD}{38} \\), we can set \\( DE = 20k \\), \\( EF = 22k \\), and \\( FD = 38k \\) for some positive constant \\( k \\). The perimeter of \\( \\triangle DEF \\) is \\( 20k + 22k + 38k = 80k \\). Since \\( \\triangle DEF \\) is similar to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and the side length of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is 1, the ratio of the perimeters of \\( \\triangle DEF \\) to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is \\( 80k \\). However, the similarity ratio is the same as the ratio of the corresponding sides, so \\( k = \\frac{1}{80} \\).

Since \\( \\triangle DEF \\) is a triangle with sides \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), \\( \\frac{11}{40} \\), and \\( \\frac{19}{40} \\), we can use Heron's formula.

      "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of kids that can buy candies under the given conditions. Let's go through the solution step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Model the Problem as a Multigraph\nWe model the problem using a multigraph where each color of candy is a vertex, and each kid is an edge connecting two vertices (colors). Each vertex (color) has a degree of at most \\(2n\\) because each kid buys 2 candies of different colors, and there are \\(2n\\) candies of each color.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Matching Number\nThe matching number \\(\\nu\\) of a graph is the size of the largest set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. In our multigraph, the condition \"among any \\(k+1\\) kids, two share a color\" implies that the matching number \\(\\nu\\) must be at most \\(k\\). This is because if there were \\(k+1\\) edges in a matching, then there would be \\(k+1\\) colors, and among these \\(k+1\\) colors, no two edges (kids) could share a common color, contradicting the given condition.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Edge-Coloring Inequality\nWe use the edge-coloring inequality for the maximum number of edges \\(m\\) in a multigraph with maximum degree \\(\\Delta\\). The inequality states that the edge chromatic number \\(\\chi'\\) of a graph is at most \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\right\\rceil\\). For our multigraph, \\(\\Delta \\leq 2n\\), so the edge chromatic number \\(\\chi'\\) is at most \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{2n}{2} \\right\\rceil = n\\).\n\n### Step 4: Relate the Matching Number to the Number of Edges\nThe matching number \\(\\nu\\) is at most \\(k\\), and the edge chromatic number \\(\\chi'\\) is at most \\(n\\). The number of edges \\(m\\) in the multigraph can be bounded using the inequality:\n\\[\nm \\leq \\chi' \\cdot \\nu \\leq n \\cdot k\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Construct a Mult matching to Achieve the Upper Bound\nTo check if this upper bound is tight, we construct \\(k\\) disjoint triples of colors. For each triple, we put \\(n\\) parallel edges on each of the three pairs of colors inside the triple. This ensures that each vertex has degree \\(2n\\) and any two edges in the same triple are adjacent. The matching number \\(\\nu\\) across all triples is exactly \\(k\\), and the total number of edges \\(m\\) is:\n\\[\nm = 3n \\cdot k\n\\]\nsince each triple contributes \\(3n\\) edges and there are \\(k\\) such triples.\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Upper Bound\nWe need to verify that the upper bound \\(m \\leq 3nk\\) is tight. Since we have constructed a multigraph with \\(m = 3nk\\) edges and \\(\\nu = k\\), and the condition \"among any \\(k+1\\) kids, two share a color\" is satisfied, the upper bound is indeed tight.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of kids is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3nk}\n\\]"

If 503 divides \\( x \\), then \\( xyz \\equiv 0 \\pmod{503} \\) would force \\( xyz + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{503} \\), which means the 503-adic valuation of the right-hand side would be exactly 1. However, the left-hand side would be divisible by \\( 503^3 \\), a contradiction. Therefore, 503 does not divide \\( x \\). This implies that 503 must divide \\( y^3 + z^3 \\). Since 503 is a prime and the map \\( t \\rightarrow t^3 \\) is a bijection on the nonzero residues modulo 503, we have \\( y^3 \\equiv -z^3 \\pmod{503} \\), which implies \\( y \\equiv -z \\pmod{503} \\).

      "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum possible value of \\( n \\) such that there exist reals \\( a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n \\) which satisfy the condition that the set of all pairwise differences \\( \\{ |a_i - a_j| \\mid 1 \\leq i < j \\leq n \\} \\) is equal to \\( \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\right\\} \\).\n\nWe start by noting that the number of distinct pairwise differences is \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\). For \\( n = 7 \\), we have \\( \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21 \\) differences, and we need to check if it is possible to arrange 7 reals such that all integers from 1 to 21 are covered.\n\nLet's consider the set \\( A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) and the set \\( B = \\{7, 8, 9, \\dots, n\\} \\). We need to form 20 sets \\( A_i \\) (each containing 8 numbers) such that each set \\( A_i \\) contains three numbers from \\( A \\) and five numbers from \\( B \\), and the intersection of any two sets \\( A_i \\) and \\( A_j \\) contains at most two elements.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the minimum value of \\( n \\). If \\( n = 12 \\), then the set \\( B \\) has 6 elements. We can form 20 sets \\( A_i \\) as follows:\n- Choose 3 elements from \\( A \\) and 5 elements from \\( B \\).\n- The number of ways to choose 3 elements from 6 is \\( \\binom{6}{3} = 20 \\).\n\nThis means we can form exactly 20 sets \\( A_i \\), each containing 8 elements, with the required properties. We need to check if this configuration can realize all the differences from 1 to 21.\n\nThe differences within the set \\( A \\) are \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\). The differences within the set \\( B \\) are \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) (since the smallest difference between any two elements in \\( B \\) is 1). The differences between elements of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are \\( \\{6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21\\} \\).\n\nSince all the differences from 1 to 21 are covered, the minimum possible value of \\( n \\) is \\( \\boxed{12} \\)."
