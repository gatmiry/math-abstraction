In particular, for each a in S there must be some other element sharing a prime factor with a; and for any pair a,b, there must be a “connector” sharing (at least) one prime factor with each of a and b (possibly different primes for a and b).\n",

    "From the second observation we note that primes larger than 7 may still divide elements of S, but S can contain at most one of them as a prime element; moreover, whenever a prime p>7 is itself in S together with any other prime r in S, (C2) forces S to contain some multiple of pr (if within 108).\n",

    "A convenient way to implement both constraints is to keep all prime divisibility within the fixed small set {2,3,5,7,11}, and then manage which combinations are allowed.

If a and b are distinct primes p and q, then c' must be a multiple of pq. Therefore, such a c' exists in {1, ..., 108} if and only if pq ≤ 108.
