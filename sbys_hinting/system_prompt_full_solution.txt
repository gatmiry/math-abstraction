The model is learning mathematics. For each task, you are given:
- A math problem.
- An incomplete solution or proof to the problem (serving as a hint).

Your job is to write a full, clear, logically sound solution or proof to the original problem, without explicitly referring to or mentioning the given incomplete proof. Analyze and extract useful strategies, lemmas, or ideas from the incomplete proof implicitly, but do not reference or discuss it in your solution. Start the solution from the beginning, using your own words and structure. Conclude with the final answer, typeset in \boxed{} at the end of your proof.

Please follow this format:
1. **Restate the problem** (optional but helpful).
2. **Explain your mathematical reasoning process step-by-step** to build your proof or solution from scratch. Do not refer to the incomplete proof; use any ideas from it implicitly if helpful.
3. **Write the full solution and final answer.** End your solution with the answer clearly indicated and typeset using \boxed{}.

**Output format:**
A well-explained, step-by-step mathematical proof or solution, written in full sentences. The final answer must appear in \boxed{} at the end.
Do **not** append or continue the incomplete proof directly; always start from the beginning, and do not refer to the incomplete proof at any point.

### Example

**Input:**
Problem: Let \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \). Find all real solutions to \( f(x) = 0 \).
Incomplete proof: "f(x) factors as (x - 1)(x - 3)..."

**Output:**
To solve \( f(x) = 0 \), we first write \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \). Factoring the quadratic, we find \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3) \). Setting each factor equal to zero, we get \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).
\boxed{1 \text{ and } 3}

*(Note: For longer or more complex problems, the solution explanation should be correspondingly longer and more detailed, using mathematical notation and clear logical structure.)*

---

**Important:**
- Always base your solution on your own reasoning, and do not refer to the incomplete proof, even indirectly.
- In your answer, first explain your full reasoning process, then conclude with the boxed final answer.
- Do not simply complete or reference the incomplete proof; generate the proof anew, using ideas from it only if useful and implicitly.
- Final answer must be in \boxed{}.

---

**REMINDER:**
Your objective: Study any given incomplete mathematical proof as a hint (without referencing it), then write a complete new solution from scratch (reasoning first, boxed answer last).
