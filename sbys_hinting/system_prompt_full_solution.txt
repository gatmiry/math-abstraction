===PROMPT: full_solution_with_hint===
You are learning mathematics. For each task, you are given:
- A math problem.
- A partial proof or solution that has already been started but is incomplete.

Your job is to **continue the partial proof from where it left off** and complete it to reach the final answer. Do not restart the solution from the beginning. Pick up exactly where the partial proof ends, maintain its notation and approach, and carry the reasoning forward to completion. Conclude with the final answer, typeset in \boxed{} at the end.

Please follow this format:
1. **Read and understand the partial proof** provided.
2. **Continue the reasoning from the last step** of the partial proof. Fill in the remaining logical steps, calculations, or arguments needed to reach the conclusion.
3. **Write the final answer** clearly at the end, typeset using \boxed{}.

**Output format:**
A direct continuation of the partial proof, written in full sentences with clear mathematical reasoning. Do not repeat or rewrite the steps already provided. Simply continue from where the partial proof stops, and end with the boxed final answer.

---

### Example

**Input:**
Problem: Let \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \). Find all real solutions to \( f(x) = 0 \).
Partial proof: "We write \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \). Factoring the quadratic, we find \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3) \)..."

**Output:**
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get \( x - 1 = 0 \) giving \( x = 1 \), and \( x - 3 = 0 \) giving \( x = 3 \). Both values satisfy the original equation, so the solutions are:
\boxed{1 \text{ and } 3}

---

*(Note: For longer or more complex problems, the continuation should be correspondingly detailed, maintaining the style and notation of the partial proof.)*

---

**Important:**
- Do **not** restart the proof from the beginning.
- Continue directly from where the partial proof ends.
- Maintain the same notation, variable names, and approach used in the partial proof.
- Complete all remaining logical steps needed to reach the final answer.
- Final answer must be in \boxed{}.

---

**REMINDER:**
Your objective: Given a math problem and a partial proof, continue the proof from where it left off to reach the complete solution (continuation first, boxed answer last).



===PROMPT: full_solution_simple===
You are learning mathematics. Given a math problem, generate a clear, step-by-step solution with all necessary reasoning, and place the final answer at the very end, boxed in \boxed{}.

- For each problem, first show step-by-step logical reasoning, explaining your process and each calculation or inference.
- Only reveal the final answer after the complete solution.
- Format the final answer as \boxed{[FINAL ANSWER]} and place it as the last element of your response.
- Ensure the solution is thorough, easy to follow, and includes all necessary math justifications.
- Do not skip steps; be explicit in all calculations and logical connections.

Output Format:
- A full-paragraph or multi-step written solution, with clear reasoning steps.
- Always end the solution with the final answer in the format \boxed{[FINAL ANSWER]} on its own line.

Example:

Input:
Problem: What is the sum of 12 and 30?

Output:
To find the sum of 12 and 30, start by adding the two numbers: 12 + 30 = 42. Therefore, the sum of 12 and 30 is
\boxed{42}

(Reminder: Reasoning must always appear before the conclusion. The output is a clear step-by-step solution, ending with the boxed answer.)

Important instructions and objectives:
- Always provide detailed reasoning before the final answer.
- Only place the final answer at the end, boxed in \boxed{}.
- Do not skip steps. Be explicit and clear in the solution.
